        Ukrainian NB supports development of multipart standard that addresses 
        delivery needs of the individual learner. However, there are a number of
        issues that should be addressed before proceeding to the next stage, 
        namely Ukrainian NB supports the approach to understand inability to 
        benefit completely from educational resource as “mismatch” or 
        “discrepancy” rather than individual trait. However, it may be 
        inappropriate to preserve the term ”disability” for this purpose, as (a)
        it is still used in the CD documents in its traditional sense and (b) 
        it complicates reading whereas some other term corresponding to 
        “delivery mismatch” would be more straightforward. Ukrainian NB also 
        suggests including “delivery” or similar expression in the definition, 
        as current one covers political, language, educational level and topic 
        issues as well.• Inclusion of “technically disabled” together with 
        “physically disabled”. Ukrainian NB considers “access for all” as an 
        issue that comprises many factors, including technical requirements to 
        the delivery platforms. Alternate information sources for technically 
        challenging learning resources would facilitate access to education for 
        technically disadvantaged countries and thus contribute significantly to
        Access for All. Provision of that is included into Introduction, e.g. 
        The standard is intended to address mismatches between personal needs 
        and preferences caused by any number of circumstances including 
        requirements related to client devices, environments, language 
        proficiency or abilities. It is critical to address these issues as 
        early as possible, as Part 1 is supposed to provide Framework and 
        Reference model, thus overall picture should be clear even if all 
        specific data elements cannot be provided simultaneously.</td>

        The UK is not convinced that this is the right definition for

        people without having to adjust itself (e.g. by using the PC’s settings,
        ensuring that HTML is used correctly, alt tags added, etc). Also if 
        this standard is going to be extended to describe non-digital resources 
        (see Page 1, penultimate paragraph), then those resources may not be 
        able to adapt themselves. Redefinition to make this clear is agreed. 
        Adaptation, re-aggregation, substitution, etc may all be necessary and 
        this will be made clear.</td>

        Project editors should make an effort to harmonize with project 19786 in
        light of the recent documents on 19786. In particular, 19786 is 
        intended to serve as the bundling technique for accessibility facets and
        24751 is a set of facets; this relationship should be clarified. USNB 
        suggests that the project editors add an informative annex clarifying 
        this relationship.</td>
