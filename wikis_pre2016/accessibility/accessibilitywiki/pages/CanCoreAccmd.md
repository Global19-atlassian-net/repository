**Access 4 All & Cancore:**

Interoperability is a key concept in e-learning standardization. To quote one frequently-cited definition, “interoperability” refers to the ability of “two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged.” Thus, computer platforms of different kinds can all exchange email, Webpages and more without significant compatibility issues.

Interoperability is also key to understanding [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) specifications for e-learning. They enable similar “interoperation” between computer systems, but also deal with the inter-operation of learners and these systems. These standards address mis-matches between learner needs and computer systems; they consider every learner, in a sense, as a potential system, with which an exernal system (e.g. WebCT, a Java applet, a discussion forum) needs to interoperate. Mismatches, interruptions and other issues in the interoperation between the learner and these systems become more common as computing and Internet access becomes more portable, flexible and ubiquitous: robbing our vision of the screen in direct sunlight or while driving; depriving us of hearing while working on a flight. These mis-matches can be serious, and are important to address. When they are long term or permanent, addressing them can make the difference between full access or none at all. In this sense, these [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) specifications “do not address personal traits, but artifacts of a relationship between the learner and the learning environment or [system of] educational delivery; and “accessibility” becomes the ability of these environments, systems and content to adapt to the needs of all learners.

In discussing this adaptability and interoperation, there are, of course, two “systems” that need to be accounted for and whose successful inter-operation needs to be supported: the learner and the information they are encountering through their interfaces with the computer -wether this information be a bulletin board, a learning object, or whether it be encountered via a screen, speakers, Braille reader, or a different interface. As a result, [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) provides one specification for the learner (as a part of the Learner Information Profile or LIP) and a second for the content (as a part of the Learning Object Metadata standard or the LOM).

The second of these, the LOM standard for educational content, specifies how this content (or “educational objects”) are to be described, classified: which age groups and contexts they may be appropriate for. It is in connection with the LOM, of course, that [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) enters the picture. [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore)’s main goal has been to support the implementation of the LOM standard for educational content. [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) has done this by indicating which elements are important under different circumstances, and by explaining precisely what each element means, and how it is to be implemented technically.

There are 76 of these items or elements in the LOM in total, and [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) provides guidelines or support for each of these. However, these elements do not describe this learning content in such a way that it can be used with the user’s needs or circumstances --in such a way as to support adaptability or interoperability between the learner and the system. The [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) specification outlines these elements, and defines them in such a way that they can be matched with corresponding information, elements, in the LIP. (The [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) specification for the LOM is known as ACCMD --“MD” being short for metadata-- and the corresponding specification for the LIP is known as the ACCLIP.) Having supported the elements of the LOM, and having the provision of access to learning resources as its primary goal, [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) is consequently also supporting -developing guidelines, examples, implementation advice, etc.-- for the [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) metadata. The first task in [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore)’s support for the ACCMD is to create an “accessible” introduction to this specification --with a view to explaining it to non-experts, but also to directing the efforts of implementers and indexers. That is the purpose of the present document.

Hello everyone,

Here are a few edits I am suggesting. I am leaving the original above as well. I don't believe I had the full document when I made these suggestions last week so I didn't comment on some areas not in my version.

Thanks,

Toni

Interoperability is a key concept in e-learning standardization. To quote one frequently-cited definition, “interoperability” refers to the ability of “two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged.” Thus, computer platforms of different kinds can all exchange email, Webpages and more, usually without significant compatibility issues. In the arena of e-learning, interoperability suggests the storing, processing and exchanging of instructional content, student records and other kinds of information by different and often divers systems.

Interoperability is also central to understanding the [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) specifications. These specifications, available from IMS and currently being updated as ISO standards, enable a similar “interoperation” between computer systems. Simultaneously, they also support a different kind of inter-operation, namely between these systems and their end-users or learners. These standards address and ensure matches between the learner's needs and computer systems; they consider every learner, in a sense, as a potential system, that an external system (e.g. WebCT, a Java applet, a discussion forum) needs to interoperate. Mismatches, interruptions and other issues in the operation between the learner and these systems become more common as computing and Internet access becomes more portable, flexible and ubiquitous: robbing our vision of the screen in direct sunlight or while driving; depriving us of hearing while working on a flight. Ensuring these barriers to access can be adequately addresses is the focus of the [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) specifications. Whether short term or permanent, addressing these barriers can make the difference between full access or none at all. In this sense, these [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) specifications “do not address personal traits, but artifacts of a relationship between the learner and the learning environment or [system of] educational delivery; and “accessibility” becomes the ability of these environments, systems and content to adapt to the needs of all learners.

In considering this adaptability and interoperation there are two “systems” that need to be accounted for and whose successful inter-operation needs to be supported: the learner, on the one hand, and the system or the content that the learner is using, on the other. As a result, [Access4All](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/Access4All) provides one specification for the learner (as a part of the Learner Information Profile or LIP) and a second for the content (as a part of the Learning Object Metadata standard or the LOM). In matching these specifications, the users needs can be met and, consequently, has access to the content they seek.

The second of these, the LOM standard for educational content, specifies how this content (or “educational objects”) are to be described, classified: which age groups and contexts they may be appropriate for, etc. It is in connection with the LOM, of course, that [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) enters the picture. [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore)’s main goal has been to support the implementation of the LOM standard for educational content.
