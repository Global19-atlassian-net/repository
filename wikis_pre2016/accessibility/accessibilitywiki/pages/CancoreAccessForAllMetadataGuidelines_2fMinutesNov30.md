Minutes [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) Meeting Nov 30th 5:00 pm Atlantic Attendees: 

Anthony Roberts, Anastasia Cheetam, Andy Heath, Karin Lundgreen, Louis Guerette, Deb Fralick, Joeseph Scheuhammer

There was discussion about the date for our next meeting as the last Wednesday of the month is Dec 28th when most won't be available. It was decided to go with Dec 13th at 6:00pm Atlantic. Toni to send out inviations.

Moved on to discussion about 1.6 Hazard. It was decided to edit as per the latest on the wiki (see Hazard element). Some text was added to the implementations notes to clarify that flashing could be text, animations, etc. It was also noted that it is expected that the vocabulary would be expanded beyond the single vocabulary of "flashing". The technical implementations notes should reflect this.

There was discussion and work on the 1.7 has alternative element. Some clarifying text was added and Toni noted that text examples should contain text only to be consistent with the [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) guidelines. It was agreed that this approach was acceptable. It was noted that the element should be repeated for each instance as required and this was reflected in the notes. It was also noted that there is some question about the XML example. It was noted that there are a few possible ways to display the XML examples. Anastasia checked with one of the ARTC's technical staff and they confirmed that the way the XML examples were done in the [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) Guidelines was acceptable. It was decided for consistency that we should use examples similar to that of the current [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) Guidelines for the Accessibility Guidelines we are working on.

Discussion re next meeting. It was decided that December 13th at 6:00pm Atlantic would be our next meeting replacing the Dec 28th meeting (as most institutions will be closed over the xmas break). Andy asked about having the meeting on a different day and time. No decision has been made about a new meeting day or time on an ongoing basis.

Adjourned: 6:00pm
