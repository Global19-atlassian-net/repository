#### Technical Implementation Notes
This element used to indicate the method required to access the original resource. 
#### Vocabulary Recommendations
Indicate what senses are required to access the original unadapted resource. Choose one of the following: 

auditory - perceived by the sense of human hearing or its equivalent

tactile - perceived by the sense of human touch or its equiivalent

textual - perceived by access to or transformation of character strings or text

visual - perceived by the sense of human sight or its equiivalent

Note that is is expected that the following vocabulary item will be added to this controlled vocabulary in the upcoming ISO documentation

olfactory - perceived by the sense of human smell or its equivalent

#### Text Example
auditory 
#### XML Example
<pre>&lt;accmd:originalaccessmode&gt;auditory&lt;/accmd:originalaccessmode&gt;</pre>

 ...ummm. this is confusing to me. We need to explain what we mean by original, and we need to explain what we mean by the modes - the point about this term is that it indicates the accessMode of the 'original' resource - I do not know why the word 'produced' appears in the definition of auditory. 

there is a word missing in the sentence but anyway, ... what about:

This element is used to indicate the sensory method required to access the content of the resource first selected and intended to be made available to the user.

I don't understand why we are so wishy-washy about the vocab - if we don't want them to use it, that's fine - but if we want it used, they must use one of the following values ....

and I think they are not yet well defined.

My suggestions would be:

auditory - perceived by the sense of human hearing or its equivalent

tactile - perceived by the sense of human touch or its equiivalent

textual - perceived by access to or transformation of character strings

visual - perceived by the sense of human sight or its equiivalent

Liddy,

We have not yet discussed many of the elements including this one during our meetings (this is a skeleton/draft and meant as a place to start). Our meeting on Feb 21st will be our last [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) meeting (there is no additional funding for [CanCore](http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/CanCore) and we will no longer be developing new documentation or updating the site). We will not be able to discuss all of the remaining elements. You can look at the minutes re the elements we have discussed if you would like. There have been several barriers to our work: changing formats several times to try and accomodate the desires of the group, changing from using the IMS doc to the ISO doc produced by you, Andy and Jutta (released in Nov), lack of active participation on the wiki, etc. Just thought I would provide context.

We have discussed these definitions in other elements that share this vocabulary however I believe. There was concensus at that time. I do not believe we are being wishy washy but in fact trying to come up with definitions that are accurate and descriptive. Is "its equivalent" meant to be in your definitions? I thought this element described what is required to access the referenced/original resource and not meant to address equivalents. Perhaps I am wrong.

Given the time frame, it is unlikey we will have a set of guidelines that is as well developed as we would like.
