        An accessibility statement might be used to discover a resource 
        collection, a resource or a resource component that is suitable for a 
        user with special needs. It might be used to advise a user of 
        characteristics that will inhibit their use of the resource. It might be
        used to match a (digital or physical) resource to a description of user
        or user agent needs and preferences.</td>

        <strong>Why needed</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Resources that are made available electronically are often not in a 
        suitable form for all users. This may be because a user has particular 
        needs resulting from a disability. While many of these problems can be 
        adjusted automatically, there are some that can't. Importantly, 
        resources should not be adjusted without input from the user about how 
        they want these adjustments made. <br>
        <br>
        Currently, there is no way for a user to determine if a resource will 
        satisfy their needs. There is no way a system can automatically match 
        the characteristics of a resource to a user's specified needs. Metadata 
        descriptions of resources (and a user's needs) can be used to provide 
        the necessary information and the accessibility term proposed 
        facilitates this. When a resource does not itself have the necessary 
        accessibility characteristics or components, these may nevertheless be 
        available and discovered as the result of a suitable search. In this 
        case, they can be integrated into or associated with the original 
        resource for the user. Use of the accessibility term in combination with
        other descriptive information should enable the <a href="http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/AccessForAll">AccessForAll</a>
        process described. Without the accessibility term, there is information
        missing that is needed especially for people with severe disabilities, 
        but which, like curb cuts, is likely to be of value to all mobile 
        information users. <br>
        <br>
        Need for accessibility information occurs when, for example, a user 
        needs content that is in no way dependent on their vision, and suitable 
        for their assistive technology. Without suitable resource descriptions, 
        they will not be able to discover resources they can use. In addition, 
        an individual user who has particular needs may not be able to use what 
        is considered to be a 'universally accessible resource' according to the
        W3C WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines but, in fact, not suitable
        for them. Alternatively, a resource that is not so universally 
        accessible, may nevertheless be suitable for them. Currently, there is 
        no DC term that would make available information about the relevant 
        characteristics of the resource. <br>
        <br>
        ISO/IEC N24751:2009 is a standard for describing education resources 
        that was developed in close collaboration with the DC-style 
        accessibility term. As DC metadata is the base for many metadata 
        systems, incorporation of this term into DC descriptions of resources 
        will encourage attention being paid to the needs of people with 
        disabilities, among others, by a wide range of communities who provide 
        valuable, described resources. Many significant resources are produced 
        by content developers who are required to assess the accessibility 
        characteristics of their resources, so this term facilitates their 
        re-use of this information as the value statement for the term.</td>

        <strong>Working Group support</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        In 2001, the DC Accessibility Special Interest Group first met. They 
        determined that the DC metadata term set did not provide adequate 
        information for the matching of resources to users' needs in cases where
        those users had disabilities. In the seven years since that first 
        meeting, as the technology has matured, the range of reasons why users 
        might not be able to access content has increased, as have the available
        solutions to the problem. <br>
        <br>
        The group started by considering available DC terms and finding that 
        they were not sufficient, and anyway, in some cases, had to be used in 
        relationship to each other, which was not considered appropriate. In 
        those early days, a comprehensive, stand-alone new term was proposed and
        it was to be known as an accessibility term. In more recent work, 
        especially as a result of the increased mobility of information, it has 
        become apparent that a number of communities have an interest in how 
        content can be adapted and transformed for individual users or 
        circumstances. The proposed term is suitable for a wider context and so 
        its name was changed to adaptability for a while but it has proven more 
        appropriate to the accessibility community to call it accessibility. <br>
        <br>
        The term has been carefully re-modeled from the ISO/IEC version to be used in conjunction with existing DC terms.<br>
        <br>
        The approach to accessibility being supported by the proposed term is 
        one that makes use of metadata. In other contexts, there are 
        specifications and standards for the structuring, encoding and 
        organisation of content that aim to improve the accessibility of that 
        content. The <a href="http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/AccessForAll">AccessForAll</a>
        approach is concerned only with description of the resource making 
        explicit any accessibility characteristics, and the exploitation or 
        re-use of metadata in both local and distributed environments. The aim 
        is to provide a consistent way for content to be described so that such 
        descriptions are interoperable and thus facilitate the greatest possible
        use of content suitable for people according to their needs and 
        preferences.<br>
        <br>
        As some users have no flexibility with their needs while others may have
        choices but perhaps some preferences, the needs and preferences of 
        users are expected to be matched using metadata including the proposed 
        term.<br>
        <br>
        In the seven years of development of the proposed term, many communities
        have been involved and many presentations have been made in a wide 
        range of contexts and communities. There has been a lot of feedback 
        including in the context of DCMI conferences, workshops and email 
        lists. <br>
        <br>
        The new term was made an open issue several years ago and there has not 
        been any significant disagreement with it, so far as is known. It has 
        been adopted in principle, awaiting DCMI recommendation, by the 
        Australian Government as its standard, and has been recommended by the 
        IMS Global Learning Consortium for IEEE/LOM metadata for learning 
        resources. There has been discussion with W3C Working Groups and there 
        is no known disagreement with the approach or term.<br>

        In developing the proposed term. the Working Group considered the DCMI 
        Abstract Model in detail and shows how a potential application profile 
        might make use of the proposed term. A UML diagram of such an <a href="http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/ApplicationProfileAbstractModel">ApplicationProfileAbstractModel</a> is available. <br>
        <br>
        Some refinements of DC terms are expected to be used in association with
        the accessibility term in an application profile, possibly as follows:<br>
        <br>
        * has format/is format of - when a second resource presents the same 
        content as in another resource in a different format (MIME-type etc), 
        but usually in a different access mode<br>
        <br>
        * has part/is part of - when a resource has or is a component of another resource <br>
        <br>
        * conformsTo - when a resource conforms to the W3C/WAI guidelines, for example.<br>
        <br>
        Other terms are anticipated, e.g.:<br>
        <br>
        * has/is adaptation of - when one resource is suitable as a partial replacement/augmentation for another. <br>
        <br>
        It is expected that DC terms will be used in association with the 
        accessibility term in the usual way, in particular including the 
        following terms :<br>
        <br>
        * language<br>
        <br>
        * format<br>
        <br>
        * type<br>
        <br>
        * education level<br>
        <br>
        NOTE: It is the opinion of the Working Group, discussed on many 
        occasions, that it would not be possible to simply elect to use the DC 
        term conformsTo and avoid the need for the new term. There is no 
        standard or set of specifications to which a resource might conform that
        would ensure that it would satisfy <a href="http://dublincore.org/accessibilitywiki/AccessForAll">AccessForAll</a> requirements. </td>
