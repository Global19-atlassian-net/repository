## Charter 

The DCMI Localization and Internationalization Community is a forum for individuals and organizations to share information and exchange ideas on the use of Dublin Core in their local or domain-specific applications with the global community. It also provides a forum for promoting interoperabilty and discussion on any issues arising from or relating to the use of DC in a variety of languages and cultures.

The goals of this community are:

Exchange of information, knowledge and general discussion within the global community to promote interoperability in local or domain specific use of DC. This can include:

- Use of DC in local languages, cultures and domains;
- Interoperability of metadata in the global community;
- Definitions of elements and qualifiers to express language or culture specific information;
- Maintenance of element/qualifier definitions in a variety of languages;
- Multilingual metadata description and vocabularies;
- Reuse of metadata schemas and application profiles in the global community,

Issues arising may include:

- Approval process of non-English vocabularies;
- Encoding of multilingual metadata descriptions;
- Cross- / multi-lingual interoperability of metadata;
- Community model for developing culture- and domain-specific elements / qualifiers;
- Translation and versioning of element/qualifier.

For 2009-2011 the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Community has focused on developing **[Guidelines for Translating Dublin Core Specifications](/mediawiki_wiki/Guidelines_for_Translating_Dublin_Core_Specifications.md)** through the work of the **[DCMI Translation Task Group](/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Translation_Task_Group.md)**.
