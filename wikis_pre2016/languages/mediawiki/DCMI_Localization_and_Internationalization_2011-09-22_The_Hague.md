**Introduction**

The meeting of the Translation Task Group included representatives from the National Library of Netherlands; University of Minho; Portugal, University of Tsukuba, Japan; and Government Technology Services, Department of Internal Affairs, New Zealand with apologies from Stefanie Rühle, Goettingen State and University Library, Germany.

Karen presented an overview and status of the work of the DCMI Translation Task Group [DC2011TTGAgenda.pdf](/index.php?title=DC2011TTGAgenda.pdf&action=edit&redlink=1 "DC2011TTGAgenda.pdf (page does not exist)") and Shigeo described the history of the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Community. The Community was originally named as the Working Group on Dublin Core in Multiple Languages and had a programme of work to develop translations of DC descriptions and develop a distributed registry to contain versions of Simple Dublin Core in multiple languages.

**Discussion points**

1. Ana Baptista had recently asked a student to translate some DCMI specifications to Portuguese and questioned how these could be made available to the two million speakers of Portuguese. What is a good workflow? The participants at the meeting agreed that a distributed process drawing on expertise in Dublin Core metadata and the Portuguese language would be the best approach. A centralised Wiki would be a good tool to use for commenting. The Portuguese language countries now have an orthographic agreement to create a single common orthography for Portuguese and so this is helpful to develop DC in Portuguese. Ana will use the crowd sourcing approach and report back on effectiveness.

2. Translations of DCMI documents are important because Dublin Core is used globally however their maintenance is a problem because less effort is generally put into their ongoing update. The ability for DCMI to officially approve translations is also difficult because of the lack of ongoing maintenance. The participants at the meeting agreed that strong national organisations with expertise in metadata in the various regions could take on the role as maintainers of translated versions of DC specifications – and that their work receives some kind of acknowledgement from DCMI. Local activities to encourage comment could be done through crowd sourcing.

3. It is in the interests of DCMI to encourage translations of DCMI and so what are some of the ways this could be done. Suggestions were for DCMI to encourage strong national organisations with expertise in metadata translate do the translations and that DCMI on a regular basis send messages to DC-General suggesting translations – with pointers to the DCMI Translation page and to the guideline documentation.

4. A question was asked - would DCMI consider requesting translations of DCMI specifications by frequency of language usage? The participants at the meeting agreed this is difficult to do in a large open community where usage is common. In addition DCMI do not have resource to validate translations.

**Review of document: Draft version of “Guidelines for Translating Dublin Core Specifications [1]**

Recommendations are:

Incorporate use of crowd sourcing for process steps: Translating Dublin Core Specifications: an approach. Page 5 – ‘an” agency; rather than “the agency” Introduce earlier in the document a link to the list of translation that have completed already Add to table: Prioritised List of DCMI Specifications for Translation

- "1" as Most important
- ”Librarian” substitute “metadata specialist
- At “List of DCMI Specifications” add to both “Dublin Core Metadata Element Set.” and “DCMI Metadata Terms” to translate the human readable Label (not the “Term Name”): and Definition, Comment and Note.
- Suggestion that the translation activities are separate to the process stuff. I.e. formatting the document and so treat as separate documents. Because the activities of translating are more complex than the how to publish which are quite practical. 
- The need to solicit local people to organise selves – universities and libraries – do a call for translations.

The meeting ended with a discussion on whether the words “Dublin Core” itself are translated. The Group thought not though - Japanese “Dublin Core” may be transliterated to Japanese character set – in Portuguese and te reo Māori Dublin Core remains as Dublin Core.
