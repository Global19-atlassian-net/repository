        The <a href="http://dublincore.org/dcgapwiki/EditorialBoard">EditorialBoard</a>
        was formed during the DC-Government Working Group meeting at the 
        DC-conference in Leganes, Madrid, with the objectives to discuss and 
        further develop the draft DC-Government Application Profile. The meeting
        saw value in an Application Profile as a reference model to be used in 
        government implementations. Rather than developing a "one size fits 
        all" AP, this could serve as a good practice example, dealing with 
        issues relevant to governments.</td>

        Read the workplan, then the issues and don't hesitate to change whatever
        you think would improve the government application profile. To track

        After making changes please send a notification to the DC-Government 
        mailinglist: <a href="mailto:DC-GOVERNMENT@JISCMAIL.AC.UK.">DC-GOVERNMENT@JISCMAIL.AC.UK.</a>

**IMPORTANT:** Do **not** cite materials in this Wiki other than for the purposes of collaborating on document creation. This Wiki is intended to be used to work on draft copies of documents. Finished documents will be published, in a persistent and citable form, on the [<img src="FrontPage_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">DC-Government Community pages](http://dublincore.org/groups/government/index.shtml).

Please announce any changes to this Wiki via the [DC-GOVERNMENT@jiscmail.ac.uk](mailto:DC-GOVERNMENT@jiscmail.ac.uk) list.

### Workplan
(Steps marked with \* have been made) 
- \* Starting point is the [<img src="FrontPage_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">working draft](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0508&L=dc-government&T=0&P=283) AP by Palle Aagaard and John Roberts issued 2005-08-10.

- \* Ask people who volunteered for the Editorial Board (EB) in the Madrid WG-meeting to participate.

- \* Propose the issues raised in Madrid as mentioned above and this approach to the EB. Call for any other ideas.

- \* Discussion in the EB on collected issues.

- \* Whenever appropriate bring discussions on idividual issues to the DC-GOVERNMENT mailing list

- \* Bring the document “review DC-GOV from the perspective of ONL-WMS” by Melle Stegeman up-to-date to the latest experiences in the Netherlands. (See issues on elements)

- \* Share that updated review with the EB

- \* Whenever appropriate bring discussions on idividual issues coming from the review to the DC-GOVERNMENT mailing list

- If conclusions can be reached, adapt the AP with:

- explanation of the position of the AP (as a reference model not a standard for all governments)

- definition of the scope and functional requirements of the AP

- improve layout and printability of the AP

- Present the adapted AP in Mexico!

### Progress

The EB is in contact and agreed on the work plan above. [HansOverbeek](http://dublincore.org/dcgapwiki/HansOverbeek) started this wiki to be able to discuss issues together and to allow others to drop in and participate, without the need to go through long mail threads.

### DCGAP Issues

#### Issue 1: Position of the DC-Government Application Profile
Describe the intended position of the DC-Gov Application profile – as a reference model, not a standard for all governments 

Proposal: [<img src="FrontPage_files/moin-inter.png" alt="[Self]" height="16" width="16">DCGAPPosition](http://dublincore.org/dcgapwiki/DCGAPPosition "Self")

#### Issue 2: Scope & functional requirements of the DCGAP
Scope of Application Profile & functional requirements must be addressed. Start with the introduction of the Draft DCGAP. It describes the scope and functional requirements already for a great deal. We could add to that a description on where and why the DCGAP defers from standard DCMI definitions. 

Proposal: [<img src="FrontPage_files/moin-inter.png" alt="[Self]" height="16" width="16">DCGAPScope](http://dublincore.org/dcgapwiki/DCGAPScope "Self")

#### Issue 3: Discussion on Elements
Charter has to be written and distributed on the DC GOV mail list for discussion 

Proposal: [<img src="FrontPage_files/moin-inter.png" alt="[Self]" height="16" width="16">Elements](http://dublincore.org/dcgapwiki/Elements "Self")

Proposed approach to make the charter: (Please give your comments!)

- \* Start from the DCGOVAP Draft

1. 

All elements that comply 1:1 with DC and with 1 or more usage get status: conforming (green)

2. 

All elements with one or more issues get status: issue (red)

3. 

All other elements get status: proposed (orange)

- \* Send to EB

- Each EB member indicates which elements are used and which elements have issues

1. 

Each element with one or more issues becomes red

2. 

Each orange element with usage and no issues becomes green

- EB comments on issues

- \* Share conclusions with DC-GOV mail list and ask for input

- Try to agree on issues and make red elements green

- Finally deprecate orange elements (no usage).

- In Mexico:

1. 

Decide to recommend all green elements

2. 

Try to discuss on open issues
