**This review of FOAF against the Agent Description Requirements ( [<img src="FoafReview_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">http://dublincore.org/groups/agents/agentFRdraft2-2.html](http://dublincore.org/groups/agents/agentFRdraft2-2.html)) has been prepared by Dan Brickley and Tom Baker. Comments are welcome. There is a comment space provided at the end of the review. Please use feel free to use it.**

This document addresses an action on [DanBrickley](http://dublincore.org/agentswiki/DanBrickley) and [TomBaker](http://dublincore.org/agentswiki/TomBaker) to "investigate and assess feasibility of using FOAF for DC agent descriptions". See [FoafReviewBackground](http://dublincore.org/agentswiki/FoafReviewBackground) for background and overview. This document focusses on the detail of expressing DC Agent requirements using FOAF's Person and Group classes.

### FOAF and the draft DC Agents requirements

The following is a walk-through of the proposed properties from the DC Agents draft, discussing each in terms of FOAF or other RDF vocabularies often used with FOAF.

name
dates
title
affiliation
location
email
other information
</pre><pre>4.1.1. Identifier
A scheme, numeric or alphabetic, or a combination of the two, used to identify unambiguously a specific individual
agent. No such schemes yet exist. This element will allow for the use of such schemes when and if they are
developed.
----- /!\ Edit conflict! Other version: -----
</pre>
- FOAF allows URI identifiers to be used directly for people, groups etc.

- in theory dc:identifier might also be applicable

- FOAF uses RDFS/OWL schemas to indicate which other properties are uniquely identifying

<pre>4.1.2 Name
The name or names by which the person is known, including alternative names.
</pre>
- FOAF provides the foaf:name property for plain text and xhtml (ruby markup etc) names

- foaf:birthdate would be a natural addition
