### The NKOS DCMI Functional requirements for the Application Profile Draft 

Our task is to describe what a community wants to accomplish with its application. IN the case of the functional requirements for terminologies (controlled vocabularies) we find that the owner/creator may want to publish share and allow reuse of their work. The user will then want to apply, implement and create derivative works applying that work to a collection. From this theoretical stance we have created the attached set of requirements and elements.

The user tasks are a need to Find, Identify, Select, Obtain and Explore. The presentation of the material by the owner needs to be in a form that the user can discover and reuse. The sets include a set of core elements, which would be mandatory for commitment to a shared repository, the NKOS CORE, and the additional elements which are supporting the user tasks.

The attached spreadsheet attempts to build a model to support the life cycle of creation, sharing, discovery and reuse. Although the proposed NKOS CORE is small it is very extensible including up to all the elements proposed in the JISC report by Tudhope and Golob JISC Terminology Registry Scooping Study (TRSS) report. The report is published on JISC's [TRSS project](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/projects/trss/) web page, [final report](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/sharedservices/trss-report-final.pdf), or the application implementation of [TaxoBank](http://taxobank.org) by Hlava or the [ADMS suggested outline](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ADMS_Specification-v0.8.pdf) by Makx Dekkers.

The tabs on the spreadsheet include several things:

1. A comparison from the points of view of the user and the owner organized loosely by purposed use.
2. User Point of View / Broad Basic\*,
3. KOS Owner Registration Reason or Purpose for Sharing
4. Detailed Elements
5. NKOS CORE
6. Supplemental NKOS core Elements for Deposit

Our challenge is to balance the "How to Describe" (a management issue) versus "How to Find" (which is the user perspective). We need to balance how much we need to describe an item in order to find it. That is How much information should accompany the data when it is deposited in the repository so that people can discover it, while not being too much of a burden to keep people from depositing the potentially shareable assets in the first place.

In the end we need to create application profiles for KOS resources which work for

1. Description
2. Repository
3. Both
4. Support described use cases
5. But not outlining the support for management of the records (add, change, delete etc) as that would be the responsibility of the repository and is out of scope
6. We are supporting Applications as a whole and not at the level of the individual term or element

We believe that the Broad basic user needs of Find, Identify, Select, Obtain and Explore are supported by the detailed elements listed in the NKOS Core and can be expanded by the "Supplemental Elements for Deposit"

In the area of EXPLORE we think there are two uses. One is of course the BROWSE function within search or Query. This is the comparison search. In this metadata registry we have two major kinds of use:

- Direct Use = metadata only which is the way it is registered in the repository
- Indirect Use = where the user needs to dig deeper by opening it and looking inside work to decide whether the work is appropriate to the users need set

The proposed NKOS Core includes 14 elements, a smaller and more targeted list which is compatible with the ADMS and JISC lists of elements:

- Title
- ID - Identification
- Address to find (UID)
- Description (Add audience, intended purpose, mission)
- Subject Coverage
- Type
- Creator
- Language
- Format
- Publisher (=provider)
- Size
- Sample record
- Published documents and forms (Print, database, XML, linked data)
- Rights

Supplemental 10 NKOS elements include:

- Services offered
- Used by
- Date Updated
- Frequency of update
- Used by
- Derivative works
- Audience (Intended Purpose)
- Full vocabulary access
- Supporting documentation
- Additional Services offered

The main ADMS Categories have been grouped as follows:

- Metadata category
- Descriptive Metadata
- Applicability
- Provenance
- Format
- Availability
- Accessibility
- Usage
- Defined Concepts
- Statistics
