2011-03-16: Report from the Glossary and User Guide Task Groups

The DCMI Glossary Task Group and User Guide Task Group effectively function as a single group -- they held a joint meeting at DC-2010 in Pittsburgh and use the same mailing list, dc-glossary [1], for discussion. It was decided in Pittsburgh that all Glossary and User Guide materials [5-8] would be migrated to a new DCMI MediaWiki [2,3]. A subsequent work plan envisioned that this work would be done by the end of February, but delays in configuring the wiki have put this about one month behind schedule. Once the materials are in place, the links will be publicized for comment -- and for contributions by interested participants.
