**Source**

- Source Definition: A reference to a resource from which the present resource is derived.

- Source Comments: The present resource may be derived from the Source resource in whole or in part. Recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system.

- DC-Ed Comments:

- Type of term: element

- Has Encoding Scheme

- Obligation

- Occurrence

**Spatial**

- Source Definition: Spatial characteristics of the intellectual content of the resource.

- Source Comments: [none]

- DC-Ed Comments: Use this element for geographic coverage. Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]). The value of this element may also be included in Subject if desired.

- Type of term: element-refinement

- Refines: coverage

- Has Encoding Scheme: TGN - [http://purl.org/dc/terms/TGN](http://purl.org/dc/terms/TGN) . Use Library of Congress URI for MARC Geographic Area Codes, MARC Country Codes e.g. [http://www.loc.gov/MARC.GAC](http://www.loc.gov/MARC.GAC)

- Obligation: Mandatory if applicable (MA)

- Occurrence

**Subject**

- Source Definition: The topic of the content of the resource.

- Source Comments: Typically, a Subject will be expressed as keywords, key phrases or classification codes that describe a topic of the resource. Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary or formal classification scheme.

- DC-Ed Comments

- Type of term: element

- Has Encoding Scheme

- Obligation

- Occurrence

**[TableOfContents](http://dublincore.org/educationwiki/TableOfContents)**

- Source Definition: A list of subunits of the content of the resource.

- Source Comments: [none]

- DC-Ed Comments

- Type of term: element-refinement

- Refines: description

- Has Encoding Scheme

- Obligation

- Occurrence

**Temporal**

- Source Definition: Temporal characteristics of the intellectual content of the resource.

- Source Comments: [none]

- DC-Ed Comments: The value of this element may also be included in Subject if desired. Prefer standard representation of date/time values in both DC.Date and dc.coverage.temporal

- Type of term: element-refinement

- Refines: coverage

- Has Encoding Scheme

- Obligation: Mandatory if applicable (MA)

- Occurrence

**Title**

- Source Definition: A name given to the resource.

- Source Comments: Typically, a title will be a name by which the resource is formally known.

- DC-Ed Comments: Supply a common title appearing on or associated with the learning resource. Either a title or identifier is mandatory. If no title is available, best practice is to give a constructed title, derive a title from the resource, or leave blank. Retain initial articles; sorting may be accomplished by using algorithms, stop words, or other methods. If using qualified Dublin Core, the Alternative element refinement may be used for titles other than the main title.

- Type of term: element

- Refined by: alternative

- Has Encoding Scheme

- Obligation: MA

- Occurrence

**Type**

- Source Definition: The nature or genre of the content of the resource.

- Source Comments: Type includes terms describing general categories, functions, genres, or aggregation levels for content. Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMITYPE]). To describe the physical or digital manifestation of the resource, use the Format element.

- DC-Ed Comments: Use a controlled list and identify the source with encoding scheme. Use lists that emphasis the learning or educational nature of resources over the format of a resource (e.g. problem set, tutorial, case study). Recommended that at least one value from DCMI-Type be supplied for a high level category. For educators and trainers, lesson plans or activities with stated learning objectives are essential as well as assessments to measure progress towards objectives. Suggest adding the words lesson (or learning material??) and assessment as potential DC vocabulary terms.

- Type of term: element

- Has Encoding Scheme

- Obligation: Strongly recommended (R)

- Occurrence

**Valid**

- Source Definition: Date (often a range) of validity of a resource.

- Source Comments: [none]

- DC-Ed Comments: The use of a single date is ambiguous. It is possible to have a valid from date and no valid to date and vice versa. It may be appropriate to change valid to validFrom and add a validTo.

Recommend using ISO 8601:2004.

- Type of term: element-refinement

- Refines: date

- Has Encoding Scheme

- Obligation: Optional (O)

- Occurrence
