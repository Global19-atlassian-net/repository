#### Notes

Question: What will the final product look like? Basically a fuller version of [<img src="June_2024_2c_202005_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Version 0.2](http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/dcmi/ed/04-05/DC-Education_AP_06-20-05.html)

Question: What's the definition of education/training domain? Stuart: based on DC-Ed brief, which is educationally purposed and re-purposed materials, not necessarily those that "could be" used for education.

Nancy Conner was not assigned, requested to assigned to Group 1, because she's working on Subject and Coverage already.

Diane explained what the process should be for research and discussion on individual elements. Each small group should determine amongst themselves who would do the following:

1. look at best practices in projects and see how the elements are used and what guidance is offered

2. Define preliminary recommendations, with discussion of decision points

3. Send message to list with issues, small group discussion summary, preliminary recommendation

Diane will set up a 'sandbox version' of the latest version, for use by the small groups as they work.

Stuart discussed some of the controlled vocabulary questions, and how we should address those in this context. Controlled vocabulary recommendations are vital to the usefulness of the AP, and small groups should carefully note available vocabularies and particularly ones which are recommended by particular projects.

Registry: The goal is to have the AP reviewed by the Usage Board and registered (including vocabularies). At this point it's not clear whether the DCMI Registry or the proposed NSDL Registry would be the home for this AP.

Brandon noted that we should continue the telecons, he suggested three weeks from now. Diane agreed to try and calendar the dates for each element, and send those dates out on email as well as on the wiki.

Diane and Stuart will update the wiki with individual emails (and send them on the list) so that the small groups can get working. We will continue using the list and the wiki to communicate and document, including telecon agendas and notes.

Jon and Mike came on and introductions were repeated quickly. The previous discussion was summarized.

Question: Jon was concerned about the mixing/matching issues, and the assumption that the IEEE-LOM elements can be included. Stuart agreed that these are still issues, but DCMI remains committed to not 'reinventing' elements already extant in other schemas. Problems that remain technically but it seems that some progress is anticipated. It may be that the work of this group will encourage continued work in that area.

Mike described some of the relevant activity in the UK with which he's involved, and the issues he sees as important.

We discussed briefly what we're looking for in controlled vocabularies--not the holy grail, but instead some relevant vocabularies, used by some communities, and available for re-use.

Stuart reiterated that we might well be looking for additional sub-properties to propose to DC as part of this work.
