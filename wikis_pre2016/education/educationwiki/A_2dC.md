**[BibliographicCitation](http://dublincore.org/educationwiki/BibliographicCitation)**

**Contributor**

- Source Definition: An entity responsible for making contributions to the content of the resource

- Source Comments: Examples of a Contributor include a person, an organisation, or a service. Typically, the name of a Contributor should be used to indicate the entity

- DC-Ed Comments: A subset of terms taken from the Library of Congress list of Relators have been approved as role refinements for Contributor ( [http://www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/relator/relatorlist.html](http://www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/relator/relatorlist.html)). URIs will be provided when available. The DCMI Usage Board has disapproved the idea of structured values to provide more information about a contributor - it should be in a description for another resource.

- Obligation: **MA**

**Coverage**

- Source Definition: The extent or scope of the content of the resource

- Source Comments: Coverage will typically include spatial location (a place name or geographic coordinates), temporal period (a period label, date, or date range) or jurisdiction (such as a named administrative entity). Recommended best practice is to select a value from a controlled vocabulary (for example, the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]) and that, where appropriate, named places or time periods be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges.

- DC-Ed Comments: Use Coverage with qualifier Spatial or Temporal; use of unqualified Coverage is discouraged in qualified DC.

- Source Comments: Examples of a Creator include a person, an organization, or a service. Typically, the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the entity.

- DC-Ed Comments: Examples of a Creator include authors of written documents or designers of digital learning objects. Common practice is for family name to be listed before individual name. This term should not be refined with a role. Creator and Contributor may be conflated with Creator being used as a refinement of Contributor. A subset of terms taken from the Library of Congress list of Relators have been approved as role refinements for Contributor ( [http://www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/relator/relatorlist.html](http://www.loc.gov/marc/sourcecode/relator/relatorlist.html)). URIs will be provided when available.
