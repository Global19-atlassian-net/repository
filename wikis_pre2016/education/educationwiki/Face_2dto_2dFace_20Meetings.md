#### Berlin 2008
The Task Group working session in Berlin at DC-2008 saw presentation and discussion of initial: 
- analysis of use case requirements;

- draft domain model;

- description set profiles.

... (as required by the Singapore Framework).

This session was well-attended, and it was (and remains) clear that there is plenty of interest in the outcomes of this work from around the world. However, there was concern expressed about the dearth of volunteers with enough time to support this project, requiring, as it does, considerable resource. Sarah and Diane called again for help with volunteering, or project funding to enable this work to be completed.

Notes of the meeting are [<img src="Face_2dto_2dFace_20Meetings_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">available](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhbqfq9m_52gkjqzbfj), as are the [<img src="Face_2dto_2dFace_20Meetings_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">slides](http://www.slideshare.net/morageyrie/dublin-core-metadata-initiative-education-application-profile-task-group-meeting-berlin-2008) presented by co-moderator Sarah Currier.

#### Singapore 2007
At DC-2007 in Singapore, it was clear that the DC-Architecture framework for modelling and defining Dublin Core APs had matured to the point where further work on the DC-Ed AP needs to be brought into alignment with it (see the [<img src="Face_2dto_2dFace_20Meetings_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Singapore Framework for Application Profiles](http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/SingaporeFramework) on the DC-Architecture wiki). 

It was decided that a [DC-Education Application Profile Task Group](http://dublincore.org/educationwiki/DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_20Task_20Group) should be formed for 2007/2008 to drive forward completion of the AP, in order to take it to the Usage Board for formal review at its 2008 mid-year meeting. There was also discussion around the idea of seeking funding to support completion of the DC-Ed AP, as it was recognised that this is a significant piece of work, comparable to the DC Scholarly Works AP, which was supported by JISC funding in the UK (see the [<img src="Face_2dto_2dFace_20Meetings_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">ePrints Application Profile page](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Application_Profile) on the UKOLN wiki for more details).

#### Manzanillo 2006
In Manzanillo a new Co-Moderator, Sarah Currier, joined Diane Hillmann after Stuart Sutton stepped down, with a view to tapping into her network and experience in the LOM community. Work was planned for 2006/2007 focussing on gathering: 

(a) use cases for the AP;

(b) candidate vocabularies for Type and Instructional Method; and

(c) information on possible properties additional to existing Dublin Core (e.g. from IEEE LOM) for consideration for inclusion in the AP.

These goals were completed in 2006/2007.

#### Madrid 2005
In Madrid the decision was made to focus effort in 2005/2006 primarily on the educationally significant properties available in Dublin Core. The goal was to set out **property usage** for the available DCMI properties, including the use of value spaces and best practices within the context of education and training.
