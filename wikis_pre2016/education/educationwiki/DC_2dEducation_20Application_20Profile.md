### DC-Education Application Profile

The [DC-Education Application Profile Task Group](http://dublincore.org/moinmoin-wiki-archive/educationwiki/pages/DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_20Task_20Group.html) is working on this AP. If you are interested in helping with this work or finding out more please contact the DC-Ed Community Moderators, [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-email.png" alt="[MAILTO]" height="10" width="14">Diane Hillmann](mailto:dih1@cornell.edu) and [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-email.png" alt="[MAILTO]" height="10" width="14">Sarah Currier](mailto:sarah.currier@gmail.com).

At its face-to-face meetings at DC-2004 in Shanghai, DC-2005 in Madrid, DC-2006 in Manzanillo, [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">DC-2007 in Singapore](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dn8z3gs_44gfmxc7), and [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">DC-2008 in Berlin](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhbqfq9m_52gkjqzbfj), the DC-Ed Community (formerly the Working Group) moved forward in the development of a DC-Education Application Profile (AP). Summaries of recent work and workplan are noted further down this page. For details on specific work items follow these links:

The Joint DCMI/IEEE LTSC Taskforce, is producing a joint DCMI/IEEE specification making recommendations for using IEEE LOM Elements in Dublin Core metadata. To find out more about that effort, visit the [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Taskforce wiki](http://dublincore.org/moinmoin-wiki-archive/educationwiki/pages/DCMIIEEELTSCTaskforce.html)

#### Current Workplan for Drafting the Application Profile

##### Timeline

In 2008, the Task Group had a time line based on the goal of having a draft AP for discussion by the DCMI Usage Board at DC-2008 in Berlin. To meet that goal, we had a fairly ambitious plan:

- March/April 2008: Analysis of use cases already gathered (Lead: Lara Whitelaw)

- April/May 2008: Functional requirements developed from use cases (Lead: Diane Hillmann)

- May/June 2008: Determination of Domain model (Leads: Sarah Currier, Diane Hillmann, Stuart Sutton)

- June 2008: Draft of AP for public comment (Lead: Sarah Currier)

- July 1/August 15 2008: Public Comment period (Herder: TBA)

- August 29: Draft AP forwarded to DCMI Usage Board

However, this plan proved too ambitious! Lara Whitelaw completed the use case gathering exercise with help from Sarah Currier, Diane Hillmann, the JISC CETIS Metadata Special Interest Group and many individuals in the DC-Ed Community. Some preliminary analysis was carried out of the results of this exercise. However, a final summary analysis is required, and development of formal functional requirements. Also, a draft Domain Model was presented at the DC-2008 working session of the Task Group (see [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Sarah Currier's slides](http://www.slideshare.net/morageyrie/dublin-core-metadata-initiative-education-application-profile-task-group-meeting-berlin-2008)). This needs final acceptance from the DC-Ed Community in light of the above-mentioned requirements.

After this, a formal draft AP needs completion, a public comment period (with incorporation or otherwise of feedback from the community) and submission to the DCMI Usage Board.

While we have continual interest from around the world in this work, we are experiencing a dearth of active volunteers with the time and resource to put into completing the Draft DCMI Education Application Profile Module. Please get involved if you can!

##### How We Got Here

The original workplan involved a relatively small Drafting Committee to prepare proposals for consideration. We thank the Drafting Committee for their efforts (reflected in versions 0.2 and 0.3, referenced below), and hope they will continue their involvement in the Application Profile. For historical information on the Drafting Committee, see the [Drafting Committee Workpage](http://dublincore.org/moinmoin-wiki-archive/educationwiki/pages/Drafting_20Committee_20Workpage.html).

The plan for 2006/2007 enlisted the Community as a whole in the effort, coordinated by the DC-Ed Community Moderators, [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-email.png" alt="[MAILTO]" height="10" width="14">Diane Hillmann](mailto:dih1@cornell.edu) and [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-email.png" alt="[MAILTO]" height="10" width="14">Sarah Currier](mailto:sarah.currier@gmail.com). There was a lot of input and interest, with new people joining.

For 2007/2008, the Community formed the [DC-Education Application Profile Task Group](http://dublincore.org/moinmoin-wiki-archive/educationwiki/pages/DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_20Task_20Group.html) specifically to work on completing the AP. The Community can monitor, discuss and feed back on developments on the [<img src="DC_2dEducation_20Application_20Profile_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">Community Mailing List](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?LIST=DC-EDUCATION) and wiki. If you wish to volunteer to be on the Task Group, or have comments or feedback on any of the DC-Ed AP work, please contact one of the Moderators. Community members are strongly encouraged to comment on issues and drafts presented on the mailing list and wiki, and to bring up issues relevant to usage of the AP in their own projects and organizations.
