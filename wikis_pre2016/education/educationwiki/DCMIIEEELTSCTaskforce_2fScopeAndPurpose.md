## Scope and Purpose of the joint DCMI/IEEE LTSC Taskforce

The scope and purpose are formulated to be appropriate for an IEEE PAR.

### Scope of the recommendation

This Recommended Practice describes IEEE LTSC P1484.12.1 Learning Object Metadata instances in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Abstract Model. The Recommended Practice will include the specification of DCMI Abstract Model terms, including properties, vocabularies, syntax encoding schemes and vocabulary encoding schemes, that may be used for expressing metadata conforming to the IEEE LOM Standard in Dublin Core metadata. The recommendation will include the specification of URIs to use for the terms, as well as a description of how to combine the specified terms so that metadata instances conforming to this Recommended Practice conform to the IEEE LOM Standard.

### Purpose of the recommendation

There is an increasing demand for interoperable definitions of Dublin Core metadata terms and IEEE LOM data elements which allow these to be used together in metadata instances. This Recommended Practice will approach part of this situation by describing how to use IEEE LOM and Dublin Core terms together in Dublin Core metadata instances. This represents a partial and short-term solution to the overall issue, which will still be of great value in the short to medium term for implementers that are struggling with these metadata interoperability issues. The Recommended Practice will also be of great value in the longer-term process of trying to align the abstract models of IEEE LOM and Dublin Core, as it will provide an analysis of fundamental incompatibilities between the two models.

### Publication

The intention is to publish the recommendation as both an IEEE Recommended Practice and a DCMI Recommendation. The details of the formal process necessary to achieve that are still to be worked out in detail. However, the following are high priorities for the publication process:

- Consensus within both IEEE LTSC community and the DCMI community

- Both communities will be able to contribute to the production of a draft recommendation

- Both communities will be able to participate in the commenting/balloting process

- Comments from both communities will be shared between the communities

- Comments from both communities will be considered and resolved by the taskforce.

- The DCMI and the IEEE LTSC will each have the right to veto the final publication of the joint standard. Thus, if one of the organizations do not agree to the publication of the standards, the publication will be stopped in the other organization.

### Taskforce structure

The taskforce will consist of members of both DC-Education and IEEE LTSC. The taskforce will interact with the DCMI through the DC Education working group. It is expected that there will also be an IEEE LTSC working group handling the formal aspects of the IEEE process. In the process of formalizing the PAR for the IEEE LTSC working group, an interim IEEE LTSC study group will be set up. However, the work will be carried out within the joint taskforce. The LTSC and the DCMI will need to recognize this joint taskforce as the locus for the work on the recommendation.

Membership in IEEE LTSC will not be mandatory, and the mailing list will be open to anyone. It is expected that taskforce documents will be referenced both from the [<img src="DCMIIEEELTSCTaskforce_2fScopeAndPurpose_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">IEEE LTSC web site](http://www.ieeeltsc.org/) and the [<img src="DCMIIEEELTSCTaskforce_2fScopeAndPurpose_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">DC Education working group web site](http://dublincore.org/groups/education), regardless of where they are actually hosted.

The initial technical editors will include:

- Mikael Nilsson

- Andy Powell

- Pete Johnston

The taskforce will be lead by [<img src="DCMIIEEELTSCTaskforce_2fScopeAndPurpose_files/moin-inter.png" alt="[Self]" height="16" width="16">Mikael Nilsson](http://dublincore.org/educationwiki/MikaelNilsson "Self") and Jon Mason.
