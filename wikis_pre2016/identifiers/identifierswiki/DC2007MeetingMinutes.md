## Identifiers Special Session Minutes, DC-2007, Singapore, 30 August 2007

### Meeting Summary

- 33 people attended

- Five minute presentations:

  - NISO digital identifiers roundtable

  - ISO Identifiers

  - PIDs at National Library Board

  - Identifier principles and compromise

  - Identifiers at National Library of New Zealand

- Discussions on identifier issues and best practices. Key points raised:

  - Confusion over identification vs. resolution/location

  - Importance of being able to resolve identifiers

  - A best practice might be: semantic/intelligence is OK for access ids, but not for abstract work ids

- Establishment of Identifiers Community:

  - DCMI not the right place to do identifiers work, but is a good place to disseminate

  - New community to be announced in October 2007

### Presentations

#### NISO digital identifiers roundtable

Presented by John Kunze, California Digital Library.

- The issues arenâ€™t identifiers themselves but the services supporting identifiers, ie. infrastructure (we've been looking at the whole in the donut so we think it's OK)

- Established info registry and 'n2t' (name to thing) resolver

- Outreach and education is needed

#### ISO Identifiers

Presented by Juha Hakala, National Library of Finland.

- ISBN now used for book chapters

- ISSN about to offer linking between manefestations

- ISNI name identifier proposal

- DOIs have a problem of scope since they can applied to anything (including things with ISO identifiers), also concern not very open and may not always remain free

- URN being pushed in Europe with resolution services.

#### PIDs at National Library Board

Presented by Ganesh Yanamandra, National Library Board, Singapore.

- Chose DOIs over URNs

  - Resolvable

  - Supports rights information

- Made application profile and mapped to DC.

#### Identifier principles and compromise

Presented by Stu Weibel, OCLC.

- The issues conflict, no solution can solve them all, so **must** compromise

- Canonical identifier - not the only id, but choose a best one. Multiple identifiers for the same thing dilute social bibliography, though make it easier to get to a given resource

- Branding - Branding is critical to value recognition, provenance, trust. Every URI is a mini-billboard,

 eg: [http://](http:///) [WorldCat](http://dublincore.org/identifierswiki/WorldCat).org / collection-name / Numeric-Identifier. Every book you look for currently has Amazon branding!

#### Identifiers at National Library of New Zealand

Presented by Douglas Campbell, National Library of New Zealand.

- Assigning a new identifier series for each collection item

- Resolver to map this identifier to all other identifiers used internally, and present on a single page

### General discussion

##### Issues raised

- Multiple identifier systems

  - Any convergence possible?

  - All are purpose-built to support communities (though that's not wrong)

- Branding

- Protocol for identifiers not always included or apparent

- Embeddability and resolvability are critical (browser plugins don't work)

- Expectations identifiers are hackable - eg. predictable, truncatable (chopped off end gives information, or appendability)

- One identifier may have multiple resolutions

- Confusion of location and identity

  - Can one identifier fulfill both?

  - Is there any meaningful distinction?

- Why not just give location (not an identifier)?

  - Not canonical, location may change, location may be reused over time

  - Library community has a conceptual model of use - FRBR (Functional Requirements of Bibliographic Records)

- Embed semantic information in identifiers?

  - No in theory, but in practice people don't use numbers

##### Best practice suggestions

- Opaque identifiers

  - Good for abstract work

  - But for service points include semantics

- Persistent and dynamic linking

  - Need to change current cataloguing practices (OpenURL/URN not URL), especially for copied records, this is automatable

##### Identifiers Community

- DCMI not the right place to do identifiers work, but is a good place to disseminate

- Support for establishing a new DCMI Identifiers community
