#### Moderators: Karen Rollitt and Shigeo Sugimoto 

Shigeo&nbsp;began by introducing&nbsp;the work of the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Community to the meeting participants and everyone introduced themselves. Participants were&nbsp;from Britain, Germany, Sweden, Taiwan, Iran, Japan, the United States and New Zealand.&nbsp;The agenda was in two parts with the first part being a presentation session from three users of Dublin Core fin&nbsp;the countries of Taiwan, Iran and Japan. The second part was a discussion session about the work of the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Translation Task group.

#### Part 1: Presentations 

The three presentations included:

1. Approaches to Multilingual Access in Digital Libraries: The Case of TELDAP   
Hsueh-Hua Chen & Sophy Shu-Jiun Chen  
Sophy described multilingual development of the Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program with a focus on the Taiwan Digital Archives. She demonstrated the Digital Archives Portal, which aims to collect the digital contents of Taiwan across many subject areas. Strategies for multilingual developments include: a multilingual collection focus, a multilingual catalogue focus and a multilingual vocabulary focus.

2. Use of Dublin Core in Iran  
Emad Khazraee   
The Encyclopaedia of Iranian Architectural History (EIAH) uses Dublin Core terms to describe its resources. DC is the metadata scheme of choice because it does not prescribe or impose requirements and it is flexible to fit different needs while it guarantee a good level of interoperability. The current Persian translation of the DC terms is not widely accepted by scholars in Iran and requires revision. A workgroup at the National Library of Iran in cooperation with EIAH is working on metadata issues and their first task is implementation of Dublin Core terms and the development of an official Persian translation and translation of related documentation. This work will assist with the uptake of Dublin Core in Iran. The Workgroup are keen to work toward translation of unqualified and qualified DC terms and possibly an application profile and usage documentation. The Group is hoping for good communications with the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative in developing the official translation. They would also like to submit the new translation as a national standard.

3.Shigeo Sugimoto  
National Diet Library Subject Headings (NDLSH) in SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)  
The National Diet Library Subject Headings are similar to and a smaller version of the Library of Congress Subject Headings. It is difficult to represent the National Diet Library Subject Headings in SKOS because it is a non Romanised language. To represent Japanese and other non-Romanised languages in SKOS an extension is required, as well as a set of core documents to assist SKOS users such as examples and guidelines.

#### Part 2: Language translations of DC Terms â€“ the Translation Task Group 

An action arising from the 2007 meeting of the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Community Meeting held in Singapore was the establishment of a Task Force for DCMES translations. The taskforce would work toward producing guidelines to assist those undertaking translations of DCMES and supporting documentation. During 2007/2008 a call was made for members of the Taskforce and five members volunteered to work on developing guidelines. A draft outline for the topics of the guidelines was developed through 2008 and includes:   
a) Introduction and development of Dublin Core   
b) What is the process that translators use now - document current practices  
c) Why translate Dublin Core  
d) Planning and requirements for translation   
e) What to translate - what dc documents to translate and prioritising  
f) Maintaining translations - ongoing maintenance  
g) Best practice case studies

Participants at this 2008 meeting discussed these topics and made additional suggestions for content including:  
a) Determining and agreeing within each country or region the professional organisation/s that will develop the translation.  
b) Working on and obtaining professional and peer review for translations  
c) Selection of DC documents to translate and a request to DCMI for a recommendation on appropriate rankings   
d) How to make translations available for DC users in regions and countries  
e) The creation of supporting documentation to assist Dublin Core users, for example, purpose of and how to create an application profile  
  
Some of the meeting participants commented on the difficulty of translating some of the more technical Dublin Core documentation, e.g. the DCMI abstract model due to the complexity of the language. DCMI is generally unable to support local translations due to language requirements but can make general recommendations and provide general principles.

An action from this meeting is that a wiki is setup as a location for the work of the Translation Task Group. Its members would develop guidelines and any issues arising would be documented. The wiki also has potential to provide support and discussion for those embarking on translations.

As a followup to this action a Mediawiki has been established during January 2009 and with kind support from the Encyclopedia of Iranian Architectural History. The Translation Taskforce wiki can be found at [http://eiah.org/dcwiki/index.php](http://eiah.org/dcwiki/index.php). This wiki will be used to develop the work off the DCMI Localization and Internationalization Community Translation Taskforce
