## Links to Cataloguer Scenarios 

User scenarios can be freestanding, or can be linked to the information captured in one or more cataloguer scenarios (["Scenarios"]). If there is a link, please mention it.

## Template 

Here is a suggested template for constructing user scenarios:

* * *

**As a...**

[user role]

**I want...**

[what the user wants to do]

**so that...**

[why the user wants to do it]

* * *

For example:

* * *

**As a...**

Member of the public

**I want...**

to know if my local library has a copy of the latest Stephen King novel available for loan

**so that...**

I won't waste a trip to the library.

* * *

## Scenario 1 

**As a** student writing a paper, **I want** to be able to save a bibliography and download it in a citation format **so that** I don't have to type all of the data.

## Scenario 2 

(Taken from FRBR 7.1)

**As a** fan, **I want** to find all the manifestations embodying the works for which my favourite author is responsible **so that** I don't have to access and read through biographies and other secondary sources for a bibliography.

## Scenario 3 

(Taken from FRBR 7.1)

**As a** bibliographic scholar, **I want** to find all the manifestations embodying the various expressions of a given work **so that** I don't have to access and read through multiple bibliographies, publication catalogues, etc.

## Scenario 4 

(Taken from FRBR 7.1)

**As a** student, **I want** to find all the manifestations embodying works on a given subject **so that** I make sure I have consulted the relevant sources for my essay.

## Scenario 5 

(Taken from FRBR 7.1)

**As a** student, **I want** to find the manifestation with a given title and which embodies a work by a given author **so that** I consult the right source for my tutorial.

## Scenario 6 

(Taken from FRBR 7.1)

**As a** book purchaser, **I want** to find the manifestation with a given ISBN **so that** I obtain the hardback version required by my client.

## Scenario 7 

**As a** reader, **I want** to identify all the expressions of a work which has at least one expression with a given title **so that** I obtain the expression which is most immediately available.

## Scenario 8 

**As a** reader, **I want** to identify all the expressions in the French language of a work which has at least one expression with a given title **so that** I obtain the expression in French which is most immediately available.

## Scenario 9 

(Likely to require use of the RDA/ONIX Framework ontology)

**As a** public library user, **I want** to identify all the manifestations held by the library which are motion pictures **so that** I can watch something while waiting for the rain to stop.

## Scenario 10 

(Likely to require use of the RDA/ONIX Framework ontology)

**As a** visually-impaired library user, **I want** to exclude all the manifestations held by the library which are not primarily audio **so that** I can use the resources effectively.

## Scenario 11 

**As a** historian-researcher, **I want** find all works published in a certain city over a particular period of time, even though the name of the city may have changed as regimes changed **so that** I can analyze publishing patterns.

## Scenario 12 

**As an** avid reader of romance novels **I want** to find all of the books by a particular publisher of that genre **so that** I can see if there are any that I haven't read.

## Scenario 13 

**As an** No hablo ingles. **I want** Quiero libros en espa√±ol. **so that** puedo leer.
