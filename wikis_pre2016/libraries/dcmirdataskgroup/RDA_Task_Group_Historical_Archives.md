This Task Group is for collaborative work to enable broader use of the Resource Description and Access (RDA), building on agreements made at a [meeting](http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/meeting.html) held at the British Library April 30/May 1, 2007. Participants in the meeting came from DCMI and other Semantic Web groups, and the RDA development effort. The Task Group is led by Diane Hillmann (then of Cornell University, now at Syracuse University) and Gordon Dunsire of Strathclyde University.

The planning for the London meeting was originally located on the [DC-Libraries Wiki](http://dublincore.org/librarieswiki/DataModelMeeting) Some information gathered for the meeting, including documents, agendas, a meeting packet, and other information of historical interest remains at that location.

## Charter and Work Plan 

Charter: To define components of the draft standard "RDA - Resource Description and Access" as an RDF vocabulary for use in developing a Dublin Core application profile.

### Workplan for RDA Vocabularies Project 

**1. Define RDA modeling entities as an RDF vocabulary (properties and classes).**

***Tasks***

Task 1.1 Analyse the RDA data model entities to identify those elements that will be included in the declared “RDA Element Vocabulary”. ["analysisTask1"]

Task 1.2 Produce a report explaining the choices made and listing open issues regarding those excluded (modeling issues, cost etc.) [an preliminary discussion document is being discussed internally]

Task 1.3 Specify each element in the vocabulary using the agreed attributes (see [here](http://metadataregistry.org/concept/list/vocabulary_id/22.html) for a possible set (to be updated with more DCAM-appropriate labels))

Task 1.4 Create an RDA namespace (a recommendation has been forwarded to JSC/CoP for this)

Task 1.5 Assign URIs to each element [The NSDL Registry tools created and manage these using an RDA domain]

Task 1.6 Create web pages containing the element specification [The NSDL Registry tools can create and manage these as well]

Task 1.7 Create an RDF schema representation of the vocabulary [The NSDL Registry tools can create this output; review of the output has been discussed]

***Deliverables***

Del 1.1 Listing of elements to be declared as the RDA element vocabulary

Del 1.2 Report explaining the choices made in producing the list and open issues

Del 1.3 An RDA namespace

Del 1.4 A set of web pages containing the specification of the RDA Element Vocabulary

Del 1.5 An RDF schema of the RDA Element Vocabulary

**2. Identify in-line value vocabularies as candidates for publication in [RDFS](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) or [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/).**

***Tasks***

Task 2.1 Analyse the RDA Element Vocabulary to identify those elements whose value would be taken from a controlled vocabulary in the library domain.

Task 2.2 Extract the controlled vocabularies from RDA for SKOS-ification

Task 2.3 Produce a report explaining the choices made and listing open issues.

Task 2.4 Produce RDF representations of the chosen vocabularies using SKOS

***Deliverables***

Del 2.1 A set of controlled vocabularies represented in RDF/SKOS

Del 2.2 Report explaining the choices made and listing open issues

***Timetable/Milestones for Goals 1 & 2***

_March 31, 2008:_

[This date was chosen to allow this set of deliverables to be available for discussion at the JSC meeting in April]

TM 1.1 Preliminary set of elements available as "proposed" in the NSDL Registry (with RDA Namespace, definitions and URIs), with registry outputs in RDF (vocabulary and single element level) and XML schema.

TM 1.2 Wiki available behind the proposed elements in the Registry, available for managed public discussion

TM 1.3 Report explaining the choices made so far and an explanation of open issues

_June 15, 2008_

This milestone should allow revised work to be available for discussion at ALA Annual (Anaheim) at the end of June and IFLA (Quebec City) in August.

TM 2.1 Revised set of elements available as "proposed" in the NSDL Registry (with RDA Namespace, definitions and URIs), with registry outputs in RDF (vocabulary and single element level) and XML schema.

TM 2.2 Revised report explaining the choices made and implemented so far, with still open issues defined

TM 2.3 Preliminary set of value vocabularies available as proposed in the NSDL Registry (with RDA Namespace, definitions and URIs), with registry outputs in RDF (vocabulary and single element level) and XML schema. [We expect these to lack definitions and scope notes, with some exceptions]

TM 2.4 Test plan for service interactions between the Registry and the RDA Web Product for registered element and value vocabularies

_TBD, fall_

TM 3.1 "Published" (though perhaps not yet complete) set of elements approved for use in the NSDL Registry and for applications using the Registry services.

TM 3.2 Revised report of open issues still to be decided before RDA formal "publication"

TM 3.3 Revised set of of value vocabularies, with plan for adding remaining definitions and scope notes

TM 3.4 Completed testing of service interactions between the Registry and the RDA Web Product for registered element and value vocabularies

Task 3.2 Identify the RDA rules relevant to the elements in this context and select those appropriate for this application profile.

Task 3.3 Produce a report explaining the choices made and listing open issues.

Task 3.4 Produce the RDA DC Application Profile

***Deliverables***

This project reports to the FRBR Review Group. See ["Namespace for FRBR entities/elements in RDF"] for background information, resources, etc. Contact Gordon Dunsire for further information.

***Tasks***

Task 1 Analyse the FRBR model entities and relationships to identify those elements to be included in one or more namespaces.

Task 2 Extract the controlled vocabularies from FRBR for SKOS-ification.

Task 3 Produce a report explaining the choices made and listing open issues.

Task 4 Produce RDF representations of the chosen vocabularies using SKOS.

***Deliverables***
