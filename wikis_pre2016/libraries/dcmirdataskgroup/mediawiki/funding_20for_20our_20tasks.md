### Current Partial Funding for the DCMI/RDA Task Group Effort

First funder: British Library contributes Â£5000 to the effort. For further information, please contact Alan Danskin, Bibliographic and Metadata Standards, British Library ( [alan.danskin@bl.uk](mailto:alan.danskin@bl.uk)).

### More Funding Still Needed: Some Benefits

In discussions with prospective funders, we have considered various roles (aside from providing money) that funders might take as work progresses. Given that the "product" we're creating should be considered a community resource, licensed for the explicit use and reuse of everyone, we've determined to make our intentions and assumptions explicit here.

1. Funders will be able to specify to whom the new drafts should be sent, although public announcements of new drafts will be sent also via a number of email lists. Drafts will be circulated to all as soon as they are available. Funders are strongly encouraged to provide feedback to the consultants, and to participate in discussions lead by our Experimental Coordinator.

2. Where this effort fits into their technical expertise, funders are highly encouraged to participate in the review of the work based on their own experience and needs. Note, however, that funders are not privileged in terms of determining outcomes of the technical work.

3. Given the limits of funding requested, funders will be expected to provide either appropriate technical infrastructure or financial backing to support their participation--no support (including technical) for participation can be provided for anyone other than the three consultants.

4. Funders are urged to consider the goals of the Task Group when providing feedback and participating in discussion, recognizing that the consultants must complete their task in a timely manner with the needs of several communities in mind.
