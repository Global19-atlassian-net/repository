## DC-Library Application Profile for Bibliographic Text Resources (revision Nov. 2010)

This Application Profile is based on

### Objectives and Scope of this Application Profile

According to Singapore Framework a Dublin Core Application Profile is a document, or set of documents, which describes a metadata application. In doing so it does not only declare which terms from which namespaces are used in a particular application or project (Description Set Profile), but also defines the entities that are described with these elements (Domain Model) and the functionalities the application needs considering the requirements of the users (Functional Requirements). Additionally an application profile can define rules for the usage of terms (Usage Guidelines) and for their syntactical encoding (Encoding syntax guidelines ).

Scope of this profile are the traditional librarian text materials - published or unpublished - like monographs, continuing publications (journals, yearbooks etc.), articles, preprints and postprints, as well as digitized or digital born versions of such material. We call this materials Bibliographic Text Resources, based on the following definitions:

- Dublin Core Metadata Term specification defines Bibliographic Resource as "a book, article, or other documentary resource".

- DCMI Type vocabulary defines Text as "a resource consisting primarily of words for reading".

Objective of this Application Profile is a Dublin Core Application Profile that meets the requirements of libraries to describe these Bibliographic Text Resources by metadata and supports the publication of these metadata as linked data.

For the description of non-textual Bibliographic Resources in libraries (e.g. maps, images, films, etc.) the DC-Lib AP Task Group would develop further Application Profiles as far as these are required and no appropriate profiles exist.

The application profile proposes how to use DCMI Metadata Terms in libraries and library-related applications and projects. It is not so granular and complex as the DCMI/RDA Application Profiles but is nevertheless adequate for the description of all sorts of text publications in- and outside the library world. Therefore it has the use:

- to support the publication of bibliographic metadata as linked data,

- to support the discovery of librarian resources in a semantic web,

- to support simple creation of bibliographic metadata within a variety of systems,

- to combine bibliographic metadata with data from non-library communities using Dublin Core,

- to serve as an interchange format between various systems using different metadata standards/formats,

- to use for harvesting metadata from data sources within and outside of the library domain,

In this way the profile will support the interoperability of Dublin Core based librarian and non-librarian metadata applications with rules and formats of the librarian world.

In this regard the Profile will describe

- [FunctionalRequirements](http://dublincore.org/librarieswiki/FunctionalRequirements) - the functions that the DC-Library Application Profile is designed to support

- [EntityRelationshipModel](http://dublincore.org/librarieswiki/EntityRelationshipModel) - the basic entities described by the application profile and their fundamental relationships

- [DescriptionSetProfile](http://dublincore.org/librarieswiki/DescriptionSetProfile) - the terms with their templates and constraints that are required to fulfil the Functional Requirements

- [PropertiesToFrbr](http://dublincore.org/librarieswiki/PropertiesToFrbr) - a mapping of the the properties of the Description Set Profile to FRBR-Entities.

Target user groups of this profile are:

- Developers from the library and non-library world who want to build a simple metadata application for publications.

- Information providers who want to integrate bibliographic data into their metadata services.

This profile displaces the latest version of the [<img src="RevisionDraft_files/moin-www.png" alt="[WWW]" height="11" width="11">DC-Library Application Profile](http://dublincore.org/documents/2004/09/10/library-application-profile/), published 10. September 2004. It is a product of the "DCMI Library Application Profile Task Group" that is responsible for further changes and maintenance. The profile will be submited for review to the Dublin Core Usage Board.
