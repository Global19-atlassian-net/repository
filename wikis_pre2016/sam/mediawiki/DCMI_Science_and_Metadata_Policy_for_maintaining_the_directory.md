## **Policies for maintaining the directory** (DRAFT version 0.9)

### Introducing a New Scheme:

- Contributors suggesting a new scheme for inclusion should post a new topic to the discussion board, (currently still under construction). This topic should have the title "New Scheme."

- At minimum, suggestions for new schemes should include the name of the scheme and the location where the latest version can be found.

- Volunteers will check the discussion board once a month to identify new schemes and determine their suitability for inclusion on the wiki.

- After selecting a suitable scheme, the volunteer will describe it using the seven elements found under _Definitions and Requirements of the Headings_.

- In the event that one or more of the descriptive elements cannot be used for a particular scheme due to lack of information, the volunteer will use his or her judgment as to whether the scheme should still be included on the wiki.

- Volunteers will format new entries as per the examples currently present on the wiki.

### Scheme Review Guidelines:

- For maximum accuracy, schemes should be reviewed once every year.

- When conducting a review, volunteers should consult the following checklist:

1. Is the scheme currently inactive?
  - If yes, scheme should be moved to a “Discontinued Schemes” section
2. Are any of the hyperlinks found on the directory no longer working?
  - If yes, attempt to discover and link to the new URLs. If new URLs cannot be found, use judgment to determine whether the scheme is still active and should remain on the directory or should be moved to “Discontinued Schemes.”
3. Is there a later version of the scheme available?
  - If yes, link to the latest version and update the Identifier of Latest Version accordingly.
4. Is the listed Maintenance Authority no longer responsible for the scheme?
  - If yes, look for information regarding the new Maintenance Authority and update the directory accordingly.
5. Has the name changed?
  - If yes, update the directory accordingly.
6. Has any of the other descriptive information for the scheme changed?
  - If yes, update the directory accordingly.
7. Are there any other changes which should be reflected by the directory? 
  - If yes, update the directory accordingly.
