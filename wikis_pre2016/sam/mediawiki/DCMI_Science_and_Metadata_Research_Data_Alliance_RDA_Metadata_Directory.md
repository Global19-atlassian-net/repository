## Introduction 

This wiki page presents early prototype work for a directory listing metadata schemes for managing scientific data. Policy considerations for maintaining a directory have also been gathered. See #About this Project for information on the Research Data Alliance and students engaged in this prototype effort.

## Directory 

**Access to Biological Collection Data (ABCD)**

- Description: The Access to Biological Collections Data (ABCD) Schema is an evolving comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens and observations (a.k.a. primary biodiversity data). ABCD version 2.06 has been recommended by the TDWG meeting in St. Petersburg as the actual standard and has since then been ratified by TDWG members.
- Identifier of Latest Version: 2.06 [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/](http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/)

## About this Project

The RDA prototype directory is being developed as part of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) ( [http://rd-alliance.org/](http://rd-alliance.org/)) effort in collaboration with the DCMI SAM community, the DataONE DataNet, and other partners to-be-confirmed. Graduate students developing the registry are affiliated with the Metadata Research Center, School of Information and Library Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ( [http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/](http://ils.unc.edu/mrc/)).
