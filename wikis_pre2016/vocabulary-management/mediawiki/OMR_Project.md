### Objectives

This Co-operation aims to mount a small, short-term demonstration project between the two parties as both are engaged in building services that provide access to semantic assets, including controlled vocabularies and metadata element sets. The ultimate objective is to exchange metadata descriptions of semantic assets available in both systems.

The specific goals of the ADMS-based federation of semantic asset repositories on Joinup are:

- To import data from other repositories as part of a global network of distributed semantic asset repositories
- To export asset descriptions from Joinup for inclusion in other repositories exposing assets contributed to Joinup in a wider context
- To promote the take-up of ADMS as a common exchange format for the descriptions of semantic assets

The OMR’s specific goals are:

- To demonstrate the ability of the OMR to import existing vocabulary descriptions (from a variety of providers), to manage the descriptions as part of the OMR array of vocabulary data, and to output the descriptions in a variety of formats (ADMS and LOV[10] schemas particularly).
- To determine how much effort is involved in building such descriptions as ‘owners’ and as OMR staff.
- To determine (insofar as is possible) what elements should be required from the OMR and ADMS points of view, and agree on how cardinality constraints will be determined and expressed.
- To build a first draft mapping between the current OMR vocabulary descriptions, the ADMS, and the LOV schemas

### Progress to Date

Among the tasks identified for the OMR group was to identify ten OMR vocabularies, in published status, with a variety of sizes, owners, and development methods. Of the ten, half are element sets, and half are value vocabularies.

At the end of March 2013, OMR shared the spreadsheet for the OMR vocabularies following the instructions and samples from the Joinup website.

At the Joinup end, OMR is now listed as a "federated repository" ( [[1]](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/catalogue/repository/open-metadata-registry)). An initial test run imported 52 assets from the OMR SPARQL endpoint. This list will be replaced by the ten vocabularies prepared by OMR. Cleansed metadata is made available to OMR as well as a sample of metadata of a name authority list that is already on Joinup.

Communications are on-going; we expect to have more news in April.

#### Element sets

- [RDA roles](http://metadataregistry.org/schema/show/id/4.html)
- [MARC21rdf 00X](http://metadataregistry.org/schema/show/id/38.html)
- [FRBR-ER](http://metadataregistry.org/schema/show/id/5.html)
- [ISBD element set](http://metadataregistry.org/schema/show/id/25.html)
- [NLS-DOD](http://metadataregistry.org/vocabulary/show/id/37.html)

#### Value vocabularies

- [RDA Media Type](http://metadataregistry.org/vocabulary/show/id/37.html)
- [ISBD Media Type](http://metadataregistry.org/vocabulary/show/id/114.html)
- [MARC Category of Material](http://metadataregistry.org/concept/list/vocabulary_id/183.html)
- [RDA Form of Musical Notation](http://metadataregistry.org/vocabulary/show/id/55.html)
- [Muldicat](http://metadataregistry.org/concept/list/vocabulary_id/299.html)

We have also made substantial progress on initial mapping work for those vocabularies between the OMR properties and ADMS, identifying gaps between the minimal element set used by the OMR, and the richer one available with ADMS. Proposed milestones have been suggested, in hopes of having recommendations for the upcoming OMR update and purpose-built descriptions so that information about the test vocabularies will be made available via ADMIS.
