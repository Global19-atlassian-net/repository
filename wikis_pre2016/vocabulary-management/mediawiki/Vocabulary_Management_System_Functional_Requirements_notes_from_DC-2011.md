Notes taken by Gordon Dunsire during various sessions at DC-2011:

- Multilingual capacity; get the existing translations in, then reviewed and updated.
- Support translation statuses (e.g. official, endorsed); secure management of translations (can be very controversial).
- Interaction with (new) DCMI Website.
- Manage/publish alignments of DCMI vocabularies with other namespaces.
- Support the development and publication of best practice guidelines for vocabulary management.
- Support policy decisions in the area of vocabulary management and use.
- Ensure no dependencies between the data created and maintained by the system, and the system itself (e.g. URIs independent of any local system identifiers).
