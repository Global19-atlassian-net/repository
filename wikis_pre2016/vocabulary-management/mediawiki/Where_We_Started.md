At the end of the successful Vocabulary Management and Alignment Session at DC-2011 ( [http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/index/pages/view/specialSessions-2011#vocabulary](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/index/pages/view/specialSessions-2011#vocabulary)), there was a short discussion of next steps. The small group sessions were summarized, discussion on those points occurred, and a sense of the group about whether there should be continuing effort along these lines by DCMI was solicited. The Vocabulary Management Community began at the DC-2011 conference in The Hague, at a special session organized around the theme of vocabulary management. The session itself broke new ground for DCMI, both in its format (as an ‘unconference’) and its focus. The session set the stage to shift the conversation that DCMI has with its constituencies, from DCMI as provider of standards and specifications, to DCMI as supporter of innovation and provider of best practices in a number of areas, including vocabulary management. This new leadership role requires DCMI to be both an exemplar of good practices, as well as a center of activity in this critical area.

The most critical issues identified as a result of the session were:

- 1. The need for collaborative space and leadership to build best practices documentation for building, maintaining, versioning and sharing vocabularies and mappings
- 2. Exploration and documentation of issues with mapping and alignment, leading to best practices
- 3. Development and sharing of governance policies
- 4. Building documentation and support for vocabulary discovery and criteria for selection (including quality criteria)
- 5. Provision of guidance for new practitioners

During the session, an [IRC channel](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJmP-wYyTA0zbesNdy-cBclBXg3pJGMit_bhWnIuMXI/edit?hl=en_US) was open and maintained. A [transcription of some of the flip charts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vRQWczGkDhGTfOFIuMTBCsvzKiq-a_57WGT9unOexdc/edit?hl=en_US) is also available as a document. Images of the flip charts are also available from the Interim Moderator. These provided the basis for a more formal [report](/mediawiki_wiki/DC-2011_Vocabulary_Special_Session/Meeting_Report.md) on the session.

As part of the follow up for the session, Corey Harper sent an email to all participants, asking for feedback and restating our intention to begin a VMC mailing list with as many participants as possible. All participants have been added to the discussion list, and a housekeeping message sent out to all subscribers.
