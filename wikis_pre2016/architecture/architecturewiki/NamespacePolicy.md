**Glossary:**

This document follows the DCMI Abstract Model in its use of the following terminology [DCAM]:

_term_

 A property (element), class, vocabulary encoding scheme, or syntax encoding scheme. 

_URI_

 A Uniform Resource Identifier [URI] or Internationalized Resource Identifier [IRI]. 

In addition, this document uses the following terminology:

_DCMI term_

 A _term_ that is declared and maintained by DCMI. 

_term URI_

 The _URI_ that identifies a _term_. 

_DCMI term URI_

 The _URI_ for a _term_ that is declared and managed by DCMI. 

_term name_

 A unique token assigned to a _term_. For all _DCMI terms_, the _term name_ is appended to a _DCMI namespace URI_ to create the _DCMI term URI_. 

_term label_

 A human-readable label assigned to a _term_. 

_DCMI namespace_

 A collection of _DCMI term URIs_ where each _term_ is assigned a _URI_ that starts with the same 'base URI'. The 'base URI' is known as the _DCMI namespace URI_. (Note that a _DCMI namespace_ is not the same as an 'XML namespace'). 

_DCMI namespace URI_

 The _URI_ that identifies a _DCMI namespace_. 

_DCMI recommendation_

 A specification, approved through DCMI's formal process, which may define one or more _DCMI terms_. 

_DCMI term declaration_

 A representation of one or more _DCMI terms_. 

_Term URIs_ are grouped into _DCMI namespaces_ in order to ease the assignment of _URIs_ to _terms_ and to streamline their use in particular encoding syntaxes. Note that the grouping of _term URIs_ into _DCMI namespaces_ is orthogonal to the grouping of _terms_ into sets designed to meet other functional needs, e.g., as various types of vocabularies.

### 1. Introduction

All _terms_ used in metadata descriptions that conform to the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM] must be assigned a unique _URI_. For convenience, the _term URIs_ that are assigned and managed by the DCMI are grouped into collections known as _DCMI namespaces_. This document describes how _term URIs_ are allocated by DCMI and the policies associated with _DCMI namespaces_.

### 2. DCMI Namespace URIs

The _DCMI namespace URI_ for the collection of all DCMI properties, classes and encoding schemes (other than the properties in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 [DCMES], the classes in the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE] and the _terms_ used in the DCMI Abstract Model) is:

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/terms/
</pre>

The _DCMI namespace URI_ for the collection of _classes_ in the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE] is:

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/
</pre>

The _DCMI namespace URI_ for the collection of _DCMI terms_ used in the DCMI Abstract Model is:

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/dcam/
</pre>

The _DCMI namespace URI_ for the collection of legacy properties that make up the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 [DCMES] is:

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
</pre>

Therefore, the four currently approved _DCMI namespace URIs_ are:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        <strong><tt>http://purl.org/dc/terms/</tt></strong> </td>
      <td>
        All DCMI properties, classes and encoding schemes (unless indicated below) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        <strong><tt>http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/</tt></strong> </td>
      <td>
        Classes in the DCMI Type Vocabulary </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        <strong><tt>http://purl.org/dc/dcam/</tt></strong> </td>
      <td>
        <em>Terms</em> used in the DCMI Abstract Model </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        <strong><tt>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</tt></strong> </td>
      <td>
        The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 (original 15 elements) </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


All future _DCMI namespace URIs_ (additional DCMI controlled vocabularies for example) will conform to this pattern:

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/namespace_label/
</pre>

All _DCMI namespace URIs_ will dereference to a _DCMI term declaration_ for all the _terms_ with _term URIs_ within that _DCMI namespace_. A machine-processable _DCMI term declaration_ will be made available.

Some example _DCMI term URIs_ follow:

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent
</pre>

is the _DCMI term URI_ for the Extent _property_,

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image
</pre>

is the _DCMI term URI_ for the Image _class_ in the DCMI Type Vocabulary,

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/dcam/VocabularyEncodingScheme
</pre>

is the _DCMI term URI_ for _vocabulary encoding scheme_ in the DCMI Abstract Model, and

<pre>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title
</pre>

is the _DCMI term URI_ for the Title _property_ in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1.

Each _DCMI term_ can be so identified.

All _DCMI term URIs_ will dereference to a _DCMI term declaration_ for the identified _term_. A machine-processable _DCMI term declaration_ will be made available.

### 3. Policy concerning classes of changes to DCMI terms

Changes to _DCMI terms_ or _term declarations_ will occur from time to time for a variety of reasons. Such changes have varying implications for _DCMI term URIs_ and _DCMI namespaces_. The following classes of changes are identified along with examples and associated implications.

In all cases, any changes to _DCMI terms_ or _term declarations_ will result in an update to the versioning information carried in the _DCMI recommendation_ and/or _DCMI term declaration_ associated with that _term_.

#### A. Minor editorial errata

Errors of spelling, punctuation, or other clerical mistakes discovered in _DCMI recommendations_ and/or _DCMI term declarations_ will be corrected without a comment period, following notification to the DCMI Usage Board [DCMI-USAGE], as long as, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, there are no implications for negative impact on users or applications that rely on those _DCMI term declarations_.

Correction of minor editorial errata will result in no changes to _DCMI term URIs_.

#### B. Substantive editorial errata

Errors of substance discovered in _DCMI recommendations_ and/or _DCMI term declarations_ will trigger public notification of the correction to the DC-General mailing list [DC-GENERAL]. Errors that, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, compromise the immediate usefulness or accuracy of DCMI metadata systems will be corrected immediately (for example, an incorrect URL to a resource external to DCMI). Others will be corrected following a 14-day public comment period to assure that changes do not adversely effect systems or applications which rely on the _DCMI namespace_ infrastructure.

Correction of substantive editorial errata will result in no changes in _DCMI term URIs_.

#### C. Semantic changes in DCMI terms

Changes of definitions within _DCMI recommendations_ and/or _DCMI term declarations_ will be reflected in the affected _DCMI recommendation_ and/or _DCMI term declaration_. If, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, such changes of meaning are likely to have substantial impact on either machine processing of _DCMI terms_ or the functional semantics of the _terms_, then these changes will be reflected in a change of URI for the _DCMI term_ or _terms_ in question. The URIs for any new _DCMI namespaces_ resulting from such changes will conform to the _DCMI namespace URI_ pattern defined above.

#### D. Addition of DCMI term declarations to existing DCMI namespaces

New _DCMI term URIs_ will occasionally be added to existing _DCMI namespaces_. Addition of _DCMI term URIs_ to existing _DCMI namespaces_ will not trigger changes in _DCMI namespace URIs_.

### 4. Persistence Policy

DCMI recognizes that people and applications depend on the persistence of formal documents and machine processable schemas that have been made publicly available. In particular, the stability of _DCMI term URIs_ and _DCMI namespace URIs_ is critical to interoperability over time. Thus, the wide promulgation of this set of URIs dictates that they be maintained to support legacy applications that have adopted them.

### 6. Justification

Two significant suggestions were made during the development of this policy in 2001. Firstly, it was suggested that _DCMI namespace URIs_ indicate the category of _DCMI terms_ associated with that namespace. For example, it was proposed that different _DCMI namespaces_ might be used to partition DCMI properties from DCMI encoding schemes, or to indicate that a particular _term_ was originally defined by a particular community or within a particular domain. Secondly, that all _DCMI namespace URIs_ carry versioning information (for example a date stamp) that would be updated as terms within the namespace change.

On the first issue it was considered that the category of _DCMI terms_ is not necessarily persistent. For example, _terms_ defined initially by the education community might subsequently become useful to other communities. Associating particular URIs with particular categories of _terms_ was not felt to be helpful to the long-term stability of _DCMI namespaces_ or the URIs of _DCMI terms_ within those namespaces.

On the second issue it was again considered that embedding versioning information within the _DCMI namespace URI_ was unlikely to be helpful to the long-term stability of _DCMI namespace URIs_ or _DCMI term URIs_ within those _DCMI namespaces_. Rather, it was felt that versioning information should be carried within the _DCMI recommendations_ and/or _DCMI term declarations_ associated with _DCMI namespaces_ and _terms_.
