### 7. Terminology

This document uses the following terms:

_class_

 A group of resources containing members that have attributes, behaviours, relationships or semantics in common; a kind of category. 

_class URI_

 A URI that identifies a class. 

_described resource_

 A _resource_ that is described by a _description_. 

_described resource URI_

 A URI that identifies the _described resource_. 

_description_

 A set of one or more _statements_ about one, and only one, _described resource_. 

_description set_

 A set of one or more _descriptions_. 

_element_

 A synonym for _property_. The DCMI usage of _element_ should not be confused with the usage of _element_ as a structural markup component within an XML document. 

_element refinement_

 A _property_ of a _resource_ that shares the meaning of a particular DCMI _property_ but with narrower semantics. Since _element refinements_ are _properties_, they can be used in metadata _descriptions_ independently of the _properties_ they refine. In DCMI practice, an _element refinement_ refines just one parent DCMI _property_. 

_encoding scheme_

 The generic name used for the _terms_ that are now referred to specifically as _vocabulary encoding schemes_ or _syntax encoding schemes_. While not part of the Abstract Model per se, the generic term can be useful in certain types of usage guidelines. 

_encoding scheme URI_ - @@@IS THIS HERE FOR REASONS OF SYMMETRY? MAYBE DELETE ENTIRELY?

 An _encoding scheme URI_ is either a _vocabulary encoding scheme URI_ or a _syntax encoding scheme URI_. 

_has domain_

 A relationship between a _property_ and a _class_ indicating that if a _described resource_ is related to a _value_ by the _property_, then it follows that the _described resource_ is an instance of that _class_. 

_has range_

 A relationship between a _property_ and a _class_ indicating that if a _described resource_ is related to a _value_ by the _property_, then it follows that the _value_ is an instance of that _class_. 

_instance of_

 An _instance of_ relationship between a _resource_ and a _class_ indicates a _class_ of which the _resource_ is an instance. 

_marked-up text_

 A string that contains HTML, XML or other markup (for example TeX) and that is associated with the _value_ of a _property_. 

_media type_

 A MIME Media Type (as defined by RFC 2045 and RFC 2046). - @@@ADD SPACES?? 

_member of_

 A _member of_ relationship between a _resource_ and a _vocabulary encoding scheme_ indicates a set of which the _resource_ is a member. 

_property_

 A specific aspect, characteristic, attribute, or relation used to describe _resources_. 

_property URI_

 A _property URI_ is a URI that identifies a single _property_. 

_property/value pair_

 A _property/value pair_ is the combination of a _property_ and a _value_, used to describe a _resource_. 

_qualifier_

 The generic name used between 1997 and 2005 for the _terms_ that are now usually referred to specifically as _element refinements_ or _encoding schemes_. 

_record_

 A _description set_ that is instantiated according to one of the DCMI encoding guidelines (XHTML meta tags, XML, RDF/XML, etc.) 

_resource_

 A _resource_ is anything that has identity. Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other _resources_. Not all _resources_ are network "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, concepts and bound books in a library can also be considered _resources_. 

_rich representation_

 Some marked-up text, an image, a video, some audio, etc. (or some combination thereof) that is associated with the _value_ of a _property_. 

_statement_

 An instantiation of a _property/value pair_ made up of a _property URI_ (a URI that identifies a _property_), zero or one _value URI_ (a URI that identifies the _value_ of the _property_), zero or one _vocabulary encoding scheme URI_ (a URI that identifies the _vocabulary encoding scheme_ of which the _value_ is a member), zero or one _value class URI_ (a URI that identifies the _class_ of the _value_) and zero or more _value representations_ of the _value_. 

_sub-class of_

 A relationship between two _classes_ indicating that the two _classes_ share some _semantics_ such that all _resources_ that are instances of the sub-_class_ are also instances of the related _class_). 

_sub-property of_

 A relationship between two _properties_ indicating that the two _properties_ share some _semantics_ such that whenever a _resource_ is related to a _value_ by the sub-_property_, it follows that the _resource_ is also related to that same _value_ by the _property_. 

_syntax encoding scheme_

 A specification which describes a mapping between that set of strings and a set of _resources_. The mapping rules may define how the string is structured (e.g. DCMI Box) or they may simply enumerate all the strings and the corresponding resources (e.g. ISO 3166). 

_syntax encoding scheme URI_

 A _syntax encoding scheme URI_ is a URI that identifies a _syntax encoding scheme_. 

_term_

 A _property_ (i.e. _element_ or _element refinement_), _class_, _vocabulary encoding scheme_, or _syntax encoding scheme_. 

_term URI_

 A URI that identifies a _term_. 

_value_

 The physical or conceptual entity that is associated with a _property_ when it is used to describe a _resource_. 

_value URI_

 A _value URI_ is a URI that identifies the _value_ of a _property_. 

_value representation_

 A _value representation_ is a surrogate for (i.e. a representation of) the _value_. 

_value string_

 A _value string_ is a simple string that represents the _value_ of a _property_. In general, a _value string_ should not contain any marked-up text. 

_value string language_

 An ISO language tag that indicates the language of the _value string_. 

_value class URI_

 A URI that identifies a _class_ of which the _value_ is an instance. 

_vocabulary encoding scheme_

 An enumerated set of _resources_. 

_vocabulary encoding scheme URI_

 A URI that identifies a _vocabulary encoding scheme_.
