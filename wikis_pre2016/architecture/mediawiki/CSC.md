CSC is developing and maintaining national data model for the Finnish academia in the field of higher education and science. The use case for machine-readable application profiles would be to support the development of application profiles and the whole lifecycle of metadata:

1. Development of application profiles using “semantic templates” which documents the vocabulary for both human and machine. Mix&Match classes and properties from appropriate vocabularies. Create extensions to existing application profiles, for example CEN [MLO](http://www.cen-ltso.net/main.aspx?put=1042).

2. Validate the proper use of “semantic templates” (Ensure good quality of the profile)

3. Provide provenance information about lifecycle of the development process

4. Validate the instances against the developed application profile (Validation of Data)
