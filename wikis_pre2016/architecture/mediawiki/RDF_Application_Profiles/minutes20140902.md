# Tutorials for various meetings

## DL14 Conference London (Sept)

tutorial will include APs in general - Valentine: this was cancelled because only 3 participants registered 10 days before

## DC2014 Austin (October)

half day: Tom, Stefanie, Kai, Thomas, Karen (coordinating)

outline at: [/mediawiki_wiki/RDF\_Application\_Profiles/dc2014](/mediawiki_wiki/RDF_Application_Profiles/dc2014). One of the goals is to get people up to speed for Special Session (facilitated by Mark M): [http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/index/pages/view/rdfAP](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/index/pages/view/rdfAP)

**ACTION:** Karen to Finalize outline and send Stuart a description of what our audience should come away with.

continuing the discussion from last call

[http://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/dcmi-ap-rdf-19-08-2014](http://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/dcmi-ap-rdf-19-08-2014)

Karen: outline at [/mediawiki_wiki/RDF\_Application\_Profiles/dc2014](/mediawiki_wiki/RDF_Application_Profiles/dc2014)

- Validation needs in a nutshell (Kai) (30 minutes)
  - Properly structured data (required entities or properties; what is a "complete record"?)
  - Valid values (value types; IRI sources)
  - Use cases and analysis (Stefanie?) 
- RDF and Validation: What is the issue? (kcoyle and/or TomB) (20-30 minutes)
  - Difference between inferencing and validation
  - OWL in an open world 
- Validation techniques in use (Thomas) (45-60 minutes)
  - SPIN, ICV, Shapes, etc.
  - Open world vs. closed world approaches 
- Validation on current data models (45 minutes)
  - EDM (Stefanie)
  - DPLA (Mark?)
- Application profiles as a possible solution (kcoyle and TomB) (45 minutes)
  - DCAP
  - BIBFRAME profiles
  - DCMI RDF validation group work 

Total time: 3.5 hours. Each section will need to leave some time for questions.

## SWIB14 Bonn (Dec):

Kai Eckert, Lieke Ploeger, Evelyn Dr√∂ge, Dominique Ritze, Antoine Isaac, possibly Karen Coyle.

1PM to 7PM, with 3 breaks. Could have time for some hands on work with a validation tool.

# Gathering requirements

requirements database: [http://purl.org/net/rdf-validation](http://purl.org/net/rdf-validation)

Progress report on DM2E/DDB/Europeana cases

- merging of use cases, continuing the discussion from last call

- 
  - [http://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/dcmi-ap-rdf-19-08-2014](http://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/dcmi-ap-rdf-19-08-2014)
  - Stefanie: no time to work on it
  - valentine; I've added all Europeana UCs
    - wanted to link to the requirements. 
    - but I didn't understand the reqs currently in the system. They're really abstract.
  - Stefanie: some of them were ok, some of them hard. Maybe we should discuss on mailing list. I could select requirements that I understand, some that I don't, and send them on the list

**ACTION:** Stefanie to send on the list 5 reqs she understands, and 5 that she doesn't. **ACTION:** chairs to ask on mailing list for shepherds for other cases, especially\*

# Scope discussion: relation between the TG work and previous AP work

[http://dublincore.org/documents/profile-guidelines/](http://dublincore.org/documents/profile-guidelines/)

[http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-dsp/](http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-dsp/)

[http://dublincore.org/documents/singapore-framework/](http://dublincore.org/documents/singapore-framework/)

Karen working on DSP in relation to RDF/OWL [/mediawiki_wiki/RDF\_Application\_Profiles/DSPanalysis](/mediawiki_wiki/RDF_Application_Profiles/DSPanalysis). Basically the same as DSP but instead of DCAM types uses OWL property types.

Kai: DSP validation demonstrator: [http://purl.org/net/rdfval-demo](http://purl.org/net/rdfval-demo). Now has examples of validation constraints and instance data. Uses SPIN as a validation method. Will next have an OWL2 version.

Discussion of differences between validation in OWL, SPARQL and DSP. Kai: There may be differences, and so one can choose the one that works best.

A test suite could be used to compare validation capabilities.

Antoine: perhaps this method can guide the requirements; for each requirement one should be able to express a constraint in a constraint language. Requirements may be too abstract; if expressed in a constraint language they would be more precise

Kai: having examples for the requirements would be useful

Antoine: eventually we need the requirements in a constraint language

Kai: could add another class to the database of implementation examples; constraint languages are formal and therefore you don't have ambiguity

**ACTION:** Antoine to send an email to the list suggesting to record example in constraint languages in the database.

Antoine: we could do it for the examples circulated by Stefanie and Valentine

**ACTION:** Antoine to do it for two easy examples and two hard ones, from Stefanie's list.

# First deliverable

From the charter: "Report on the current state, based on use cases gathered - first draft September 2014"

- Are all use cases that should be in the deliverable in the database or in the wiki?

Antoine: I think all wiki case studies are in scope, but they won't be worked out fully in time.

- Suggested scope of the deliverable: 
  - Collected case studies, use cases 
  - Requirements from the database used by our application profiles
  - Short database description or description of the requirements collection?
  - Links to the case studies on the wiki, case studies, use cases and requirements in the database

Antoine: all of this seems in scope (even though a bit redundant wording). Anyone disagrees? - (resounding silence)

- Is there an deliverable template? Otherwise I would use the one we have in DM2E and adept it (change logos, colors and main page) Evelyn

**ACTION:** Kai to find out what template is precisely needed. - Goal: keep it short&nbsp;:)

# Coordination with W3C RDF Data shapes WG
