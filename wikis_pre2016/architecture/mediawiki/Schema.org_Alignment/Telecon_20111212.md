### 1. Sources of the mappings 

- For DCMI Metadata Terms, the latest-version RDF schemas:
  - [http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/), which resolves to [http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dcelements.rdf#](http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dcelements.rdf#)
  - [http://purl.org/dc/terms/](http://purl.org/dc/terms/), which resolves to [http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dcterms.rdf#](http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dcterms.rdf#)
  - [http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/](http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/), which resolves to [http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dctype.rdf#](http://dublincore.org/2010/10/11/dctype.rdf#)

- For Schema.org terms
  - Officially: the RDFS/OWL export linked from [http://schema.org/docs/datamodel](http://schema.org/docs/datamodel), i.e.: [http://schema.org/docs/schemaorg.owl](http://schema.org/docs/schemaorg.owl)
  - In practice: one of the versions maintained at schema.rdfs.org, i.e.: [http://schema.rdfs.org/all.nt](http://schema.rdfs.org/all.nt)

FOR DISCUSSION

- The version at schema.rdfs.org appears to be continually updated, and versions are made available in RDF/XML, Turtle, NTriples, and JSON. These versions are slightly more convenient; e.g., when the domain or range of a property is just one class, it replaces the OWL constructs of the schema.org version ("unionOf" statements, using blank nodes) with simple domain or range statements.

### 2. Publication of mappings 

FOR DISCUSSION

- The [[mappings](http://mappings.dbpedia.org/server/ontology/export%7CDBPedia)] are published by DBPedia in RDF/XML and linked to from the mappings page maintained by schema.rdfs.org at [http://schema.rdfs.org/mappings.html](http://schema.rdfs.org/mappings.html). Should we follow the same pattern?
  - Alternatively, should they be published under schema.rdfs.org, like the SIOC mappings at [http://schema.rdfs.org/mappings/sioc](http://schema.rdfs.org/mappings/sioc)?
  - Alternatively, should they published on a Mercurial repository at W3C being set up for the Web Schemas Task Force? (Does anyone know the status of this?)
  - Do we additionally need to publish human-readable mappings?
- Should we follow the pattern used for publishing DCMI Terms documentation, i.e.:
  - Assign PURLs to the mappings under the domain purl.org/dc?
  - Maintain redirects to the latest, time-stamped versions?
  - Alternatively, should we consider other ways to version the mappings -- e.g., using Mercurial or Git?
- What sort of statement should DCMI issue as context? These mappings potentially set a precedent for others. For example, the statement could say:
  - Inasmuch vocabularies can evolve, and the understanding of how vocabularies relate to each other can change with experience, DCMI makes no guarantees regarding the stability of the mappings.
- For simplicity, should mapping files fall under the CC0 license ("No Rights Reserved"), [http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0)?
- These mappings can be published by the "authority" of the Schema.org Alignment Task Group. Do we foresee a need to formalize or routinize the review and publication mappings, e.g., by a re-oriented Usage Board?

### 3. Reaching agreement on the mapping proposals 

- Bernard's proposal [/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org\_Alignment/Mappings](/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Mappings)
- See [/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org\_Alignment/Mappings\_Details](/mediawiki_wiki/Schema.org_Alignment/Mappings_Details)

FOR DISCUSSION

- Process for reaching agreement. Poll this group? On a call or online? Use Usage Board criteria ("To be approved, a proposal needs more than 50% of assigned votes in favor and less than 25% of assigned votes against.")?
