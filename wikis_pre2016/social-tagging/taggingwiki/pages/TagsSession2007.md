- More discussion

Sadly there was not enough time for comprehensive discussion but community members are encouraged to view the resources from the session and to contribute to the discussion on email list (membership of the list is free and open - see the main Social Tagging Community page).

#### The ''social'' component in 'social tagging'
Pete Johnston posted this to the list late in 2006: 

"I think the "social" in the "social tagging" term is intended to emphasise the communal or collaborative aspects of the operation (and/or the context/system within which the operation is performed), not the level of training or expertise of the person performing that operation.

In theory, I could engage in "tagging" within a system in which I was the only user - I could run a del.icio.us clone on my laptop, accessible only to me on my login on that machine, and I could post entries and "tag" resources within that system. In this scenario, I'm certainly performing the "tagging" operation. But there is no communal or collaborative aspect to that operation. I'm not sharing my collection of entries (including my tags) with anyone else, and I'm not looking at entries (including tags) from the collections of other individuals: no-one else is analysing or using my tags and modifying their tagging behaviour based on that experience, and I'm not analysing or using anyone else's tags, and modifying my tagging behaviour based on that experience. This (it seems to me) is "tagging", and it may be very useful to me as an individual for my personal information management and retrieval, but it's not "social tagging"."
